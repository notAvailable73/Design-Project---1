2,audi A6,"I liked the Audi over the Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus for its handling and style. I was surprised by the power of the 4-cylinder turbo engine, which I found perfect for my driving, and my friends were shocked it wasnât a 6-cylinder.",3
3,audi A4,"Best car I've ever owned, hands down. I am a 3 time A4 owner and love the significant improvements they've made in the 2018. Sport Package and Black Optics set off the look and the front sport seats grip my body in spirited driving. Dynamic blend of performance and luxury. 100% would buy again",3
4,audi A3,"I am so impressed with the new A3, itâs quick, it handles great, and it has great luxury. You get a car that has all wheel drive and gets amazing gas mileage on regular fuel with the hybrid system. To me itâs the perfect car.",4
5,audi Q3,"While I am reviewing the Q3 I got a mere five days into my three year lease , I couldnât be happier with the car. It is solid and drives accordingly. Quiet, comfortable and luxurious, this is a quality ride. It has good get up and go with the 45 engine, and while I havenât been able to race around In it yet, driving is fun.",3
6,audi Q5,Great suv with many bells and whistles. Smooth ride with adequate pickup. Lots of of technology that for an older person like myself can be difficult. However Audi supples on line many tutorials which are a huge help.,3
7,audi A5,"This car is as fun to drive as it is to look at. It's responsive, quiet, and easy to get comfortable with it's controls and settings!",3
10,audi A7,"I bought a 2019 A7 premium plus, and while itâs beautiful, Iâve faced issues like rolling backward, unexpected braking, and error messages that disappear after restarting. It needs technical updates.",3
12,audi Q7,"The Q7 is a stunning SUV, but its technology is unreliable, failing about 25% of the time, leading to multiple frustrating trips to the dealership. When it works, it's amazing, but constant updates can leave you without essential features for days.",3
14,audi RS3,"Contrary to Edmunds' claim about high seats in the RS3, Iâm over 6'2"" and have plenty of headroom, and the adjustable seats help. The magnetic suspension offers a comfortable ride, especially in ""Comfort"" mode on rough roads, comparable to luxury cars. While Edmunds criticizes the tight rear seat space in this sub-compact, it's unrealistic to expect S-class room in smaller cars; check out ""Car & Driver"" for a more favorable review, which rated the RS3 5/5.",3
15,audi A8,"My third A8 and seventh Audi, never any issues but this one has been over engineered electronically , buggy and dangerous ( the steering froze up mid-drive with family inside the car), even more painful is dealing with VW group to get it resolved been over 6 months",2
16,audi Q8,"Having previously owned a 2018 Q5, I found the 2022 Q8 to be a stylish upgrade with plenty of space. The comfort and ride quality are outstanding, the updated infotainment system has better screens and touch controls, and the autonomous driving features have greatly improved. Overall, I'm thrilled with the vehicle!",3
18,audi RS5,"After a year with the Audi RS5, I find it fast, comfortable, and stylish, comfortably fitting four adults with impressive 30 mpg highway fuel economy and a top-notch interior. However, dynamic mode is rough on bumpy roads, and Iâd like a more aggressive exhaust sound, though I expected the V6's limitations. There are also few aftermarket parts in the US, and the transmission can be slow to downshift. Other reviews unfairly compare it to RWD cars like the M4; the RS5 is safer and performs well for daily driving, making it ideal for those seeking a fast sports coupe without the flash.",3
20,audi SQ5,"Iâm baffled by Edmunds and Car and Driverâs Audi recommendations. After leasing a 2022 SQ5, I found it to be my first and last Audi. While it has good ride quality and power, the electronics are subpar, and customer service is terrible. The myAudi app is frustrating, requiring dealer visits and lacking essential features, which are overpriced compared to competitors. Additionally, calling Audi of America often means over 90 minutes on hold, unlike the quick response from other brands. Audi's advertising feels more like ""Lie in Advertising"" than ""Truth in Engineering.""",3
22,audi SQ7,"After owning 2nd gen loaded Q7, couldnât be possible to top it, but this has topped it in every single area. 3rd option when needed otherwise similar as SQ8, so more practical, hence in my mind truer SUV and half the price of Urus with same engine and probably more options.",3
23,audi S3,"I love my 2022 Audi S3, which I bought as one of the first at the dealership. Itâs a premium plus package, fully loaded except for the head-up display and dancing lights, with an MSRP just over $57K, but I got it below MSRP and a great trade-in value. After nearly 3,200 miles, itâs quick, handles well, and is very comfortable, making it an awesome daily driver with good mileage. It looks great, feels solid, and has become my favorite car, even over the Golf R, thanks to its superior interior and design.",3
24,audi S5,"Sold car at 68,000 miles. Developed problems with transmission and differential. Body started to creak and sqeek. Repair costs were astronomical to include oil changes and brakes. ",3
27,bmw 5 Series,Shortage of computer chips cause several options to be eliminated. These options were available when the car was ordered from BMW and the factory didnât inform me or the dealership that options were removed. No adjustment to the sticker price either.,3
28,bmw 6 Series,Need to put better tires. Have had blowouts on 3 of the 4 tires and only10000 miles.Still tires are the issue!! Performance is the best for the money. Good overall value,4
30,bmw 7 Series,Amazing Driving Experience. Luxury and sport feel in one car.,4
32,bmw 4 Series,"Itâs simply a great car. Great feel, lots of power, handling is superb and interior is perfect. And itâs a very good looking auto.",4
33,bmw X3,This car is great. My single only issue is that the driver seat is not as comfortable as I would like it and I wish it had maybe 1 more inch of lift capability so that I could sit a little higher.,3
34,bmw 3 Series,"I purchased my 2022 BMW 330i X-Drive in October 2021, and it's my first BMWâit's amazing! The driving and handling are exceptional, and itâs been reliable, achieving high 20s in the city and low to mid 30s on the highway. The pythonic blue paint looks incredible, turning heads everywhere I go. The seats are incredibly comfortable, and despite switching from a twin-turbo V6 with over 400 hp, the 4-cylinder turbo never lacks power. Overall, buying this car was a great decision, and I would do it again in a heartbeat!",3
35,bmw X5,"My BMW X5 delivers the classic road feel, running mostly on electric in town with a fast charger at home and ChargePoint at work. On weekends, hybrid mode gives us over 50 MPG on trips to the NC mountains. I'm pleased with the fit, finish, ride, and technology, but I wish BMW would increase the battery discharge for the US market; the 45e gets over 50 miles per charge in Europe!",3
36,bmw X4,"We had an 2014 x3. It was time to get a new car and we decided on a new x4. This suv is amazing. Every thing about it says ""nice"". Enough power, beautiful interior and just the right amenities.",3
37,bmw i3,"After short-lease ownership of 2017 and 2018 i3 models, I recently leased a 2019 with a larger battery pack. While the i3 is fun and zippy for city driving, highway travel can be tricky in strong crosswinds. Iâve managed long trips with frequent gas stops, but most drives are under 75 miles, supported by a home Level 2 charger. Leasing is appealing due to attractive deals, often below $300/month, and the i3âs unique tire size means youâll need to plan for tire replacement. Although it has high-performance dynamics that wear tires, I enjoy the driving experience and the reassurance of backup gasoline power, minimizing range anxiety. With decent charging options and solid reliability, it's a unique car thatâs worth a test drive, even if BMW may discontinue it soon.",3
38,bmw X1,The only thing I donât like about my new truck is it doesnât have heated seats.,3
39,bmw M4,"Comparing the M4 to my â17 911S Porsche, the M4 is an impressive vehicle, though the MDCT transmission isnât as smooth as the 911âs PDK. While the engine is fantastic, the rear tires at 275 mm feel too narrow compared to the 305 mm on the 911S, causing them to spin too easily, which is a common concern among owners on Bimmerfest forums. I plan to upgrade to at least 295 mm tires with wider wheels at my next change, costing around $2,500. Additionally, the BMW speedometer reads about 2 mph fast at 60 mph, a well-known issue. However, the interior and media interface are top-notch, featuring advanced technology like Apple CarPlay, smart lighting, cruise control, and excellent wet handling, making the M4 a great car that just needs slightly wider rear tires.",3
40,bmw X2,"The size, gas mileage, options and ride are perfect. Did not want a ""BIG honking suv"" but did want storage space and AWD -- I love it.",4
41,bmw X6,"Thereâs not a single thing I dislike on this SUV or wish to change. Itâs luxury, it ride smooth, itâs fast, & feels safe, all at the same time. The features are second to none. The heads up display is a game changer when it comes to your driving experience. The display screen itâs big & visible, & not to mention touch screen. I could go on for days about everything I love when it comes?to this car.",3
42,bmw 8 Series,Great droptop that still feels like you got some car under you,4
43,bmw Z4,"After many years of waiting, my wife purchased a 2022 Z4 sDrive 30i in Mediterranean Blue Metallic with a tan Cognac Leather interior. Although she skipped the sports handling package, I was pleasantly surprised by the driving experience; the 255-horsepower four-cylinder engine offers ample performance without the need for extreme handling. The car is refined, with comfortable seats and surprisingly good trunk space, and its soundproofing makes it enjoyable even with the top up. We swapped the summer tires for all-season ones for winter driving. While it has costly BMW upgrades, requires premium fuel, and features electronic steering that feels a bit artificial, my wife loves the car, and Iâm impressedâitâs fun on twisty roads, comfortable for longer trips, and makes a legitimate daily driver.",3
44,bmw X7,"Vehicle is very comfortable, a little to techie but eventually you get used to it. Killer interior especially if you get the rear bucket seats. Overall a very good deal for the $.",3
45,bmw M5,A great sedan when we take the kids but a sports car otherwise. Amazing acceleration and the options are over the top. Paid a bit of premium for the non standard exterior color,3
46,bmw i8,"Owning a 2015 BMW i8 has been an exciting experience, especially since I initially thought I would keep my 1991 Acura NSX for life. However, after seeing the price drop for the 2014 and 2015 i8 models below $100k in 2017, I decided to explore options for a new daily driver to replace my 2008 Audi TT. After test driving an Audi R8 and a BMW Z4, I was captivated by the i8âs stunning design, storage space, and luxurious interior. The handling and smooth ride, despite the 20"" tires, combined with hybrid technology and gull-wing doors, made it feel exceptionally special. I believe the i8 embodies the same spirit as the original NSXâlightness, smooth power, and sharp steering. However, I've encountered two recurring issues: difficulty opening the fuel door and the air conditioning failing to cycle on completely after being parked. After several visits to the dealer, it turned out I had a defective fuel pressure sensor and another faulty sensor within the fuel pump, which were eventually replaced. Now, the A/C works fine, although the controls are complex. Overall, the i8 has been a great addition, blending the excitement of my previous cars with cutting-edge technology.",3
47,bmw M2,"M2C with a manual. World is a perfect place. I have owned the car for less than 2 months. First 1200 miles break in period. Easy to drive, ride is pretty ok for me (ny nj roads) Regular driving gives me 26â¦27 mpg. Engine noise and road noise is negligible. Wish it was louder in sports mode. Very easy clutch for traffic or driving hard. Good space, awesome driving position. Nav n?electronics very good. Stereo could be better. Post break in service Iâve been opening it up a little more. Perfect power to thrill ratio. Car is loads of fun. Still have not tracked the car so canât fully share my sportiest experience. Definitely very happy with the car and I highly recommend it for what it is. My other cars include a 2003 lotus esprit, 2006 e46 M3, 1986 MB 560sec 2019 Lamborghini hurricane Evo rear wheel and 2017 Porsche Cayenne",3
48,bmw M3,"I'm excited to share my experience with the BMW M2 Competition after completing the 1200-mile service and my first BMWCCA autocross event. The DCT gearbox has been fantastic, providing smooth shifting and always selecting the right gear. The engine is incredibly responsive, making my daily commute enjoyable, averaging 19.6 mpg, while I get about 26.7 mpg on longer country trips. I've found the standard suspension to be the best compromise I've experienced, making every drive a pleasure.",3
49,bmw M6,"loving my BMW M2 Competition! Just hit the 1200-mile service and even tried autocross for the first time. The DCT gearbox is super smooth and keeps me in the right gear, making driving a blast. Daily commutes are giving me about 19.6 mpg, while weekend trips are closer to 26.7 mpg. The standard suspension feels perfect for my driving style. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this ride!",3
50,bmw Z3,"Iâm totally in love with my BMW Z3! It's hands down my favorite sports car, even after owning a bunch of others like Corvettes and Mustangs. I found this gorgeous Atlanta Blue 2.8 with a 5-speed manual and tan interior while looking for a birthday gift for myself back in 2005. One test drive was all it took to know I had to have it! The performance, fuel economy, and sheer driving fun remind me of my old MGs, which I adored. After five amazing years of driving the Z3 all over, I can honestly say it's the most fun car I've had since those classic days!",3
52,hyundai Tucson,"As a long-time Toyota fan, I recently chose the 2022 Tucson Hybrid Limited over the RAV4 Prime and CR-V Touring Hybrid, and Iâm thrilled with its performance, interior quality, and advanced techâdefinitely a must-try in the compact SUV market!",3
57,hyundai Ioniq,"I recently purchased my first electric vehicle without taking it for a test drive, and I couldn't be happier! The driving comfort is fantastic, with superb suspension and the best seats I've ever experienced. I love how I can customize settings, and the quiet interior really enhances the driving experience. There are a few downsides, like reduced range at high speeds and in colder temperatures, limited space for three child car seats, the lack of floor mats, and average visibility. But despite these issues, I still think this vehicle is amazing and could be perfect for many people.",3
58,hyundai Kona,"Found on dealers lot. It included sun roof and full roof rack. Sorta a SEL plus but at a SEL price. Cool seats, steering wheel, dashboard, radioâ¦.three drive modes. Quiet ride. Tight steering. Iâd buy again!",3
59,hyundai Veloster,"Some of my NA âs in the features is because I have only had this a week now! Let me tell ya, I am impressed! This is a little demon of a car! Sleek, fun to drive and comfy to boot! I canât say enough great things about my new Veloster! If you get one (and I recommend you do) get a turbo if speed off the red is your thing! If you more conservative like me the value edition is amazing!",3
62,hyundai Santa Fe,"I bought a 2022 Santa Fe with the Calligraphy trim on 8.14.21. (btw - if you're looking for the Palisade, Westlake Hyundai has a lot full of them.) This is a beautiful car. I had 3 criteria when researching cars, 1) horsepower, the Santa Fe has 281 hp. 2) size, I used to have a GMC Yukon and that was just too big, I don't need a third row. 3) 4 cylinders. I didn't want/need 6?cylinders, it just increases insurance premiums. The Santa Fe checked all the boxes plus more. The features in this car are so cool. Go take one for a test drive, you just might fall in love like I did.",3
63,hyundai Accent,We just bought a Hyndaui Accent love the gas mileage excellent!!!,4
67,mercedes SLK,"I havenât owned a convertible since I was a teenager, but Iâve loved this one since I got it in 2015. It still looks, drives, and feels like new, and I get compliments every time I take it out. Iâm the second owner, and while I had a couple of small scrapes classified as âaccidentsâ by insurance, the car still shines. Iâm thrilled Mercedes extended the warranty on this model to 120K miles or 10 years from purchaseâno extra cost!",3
68,mercedes S Class,"I'm starting to think every car manufacturer has its off years, and this seems to be Mercedes-Benz's turn. I've had my 2019 S560 4MATIC sedan for five months, and itâs been nothing but trouble with operational and tech issues, plus my dealer has flat-out refused to fix it! The car has trouble shiftingâthree times in one day it just wouldnât go into park, and the shifter bizarrely controls the navigation screen. I felt like I was in a scene from Terminator, where my car was revolting! The tech issues are endless: it wonât recognize contacts for directions, refuses to load all my contacts (despite following all the instructions), and sometimes the doors wonât even unlock with the key fob. While some issues are intermittent, theyâve made me lose trust in the car completely. It doesnât help that the dealer wonât even take a look at it, wonât send anyone to check out the problems, and MB executive relations wonât step in, leaving me stuck with a car I canât trust to drive.",3
69,mercedes SL CLASS,"You have no surround system, all you hear is the front speakers when the top is down. It needs front to back fader control that all S and GLS classes cars have!!!!",3
71,mercedes GLE Class,"The car is beautiful. However, missing several features other cars have. Less than 800 miles and itâs been in the service department more than in my garage. Had a bolt missing/ broken, terrible noise of things flapping/rattling on the passenger side. Picked up car on Wednesday, had it towed on Fridayâ¦.âReversing Not Possible. Service Requiredâ. Over a week now waiting to get it?backâ¦..still in a loaner.",2
72,mercedes GLA Class,"I've been driving my GLA250 for about six months now, and it's been flawless, even handling last winter's snow and ice like a champ while averaging 26 mpg in the city and 30-31 mpg on the highway; however, I've noticed some wind noise, tight rear legroom, and annoying transmission quirks, especially in ECO mode, and after three years, I had to replace the worn Bridgestone tires, but I still love the engine and might trade it for the 2019 model.",3
73,mercedes A Class,Drives Amazing,4
75,mercedes GLC Class,Perfect Mercedes-Benz...Couldn't ask for a more pristine vehicle!,4
76,mercedes C Class,"Traded in my 2014 C250 coupe. This is my second C300 sedan. Wow! This car is so nice to drive. Quiet, composed, sporty when you want it to be. I've gotten so many compliments on how beautiful the car is. I didn't get the larger wheels because I wanted the ride to be as soft as possible. Added the $5000 package and it has all the luxury i need. Seats are extremely comfortable, Steering is concise and light. Gear shifts using the paddles are immediate. Fuel economy is pretty good. Averaging 27 mpg combined. If I had one complaint it would be the back seats. They are a bit uncomfortable. Sit a an odd angle and I didn't really feel comfortable in them. Not that I care, really. It's all about the driver seat and that is superb!",3
77,mercedes E Class,"I got this gorgeous car delivered straight from Germany, brand new and loaded with options like all-leather interior, a wood and leather steering wheel, ventilated seats, and a Burmester sound system. However, I was disappointed to find a scratch on the hood that happened during shipping, but the dealership promised to fix it. Once I got home, I discovered the driver's seat wouldn't move back and would actually push me forward into the steering wheel when I turned the car off, which was shocking. I've taken it to the dealership twice, and while the seat memory function is finally working, I had to disable the ""easy enter/exit"" feature because it was malfunctioning. Despite these annoyances, I still think the car is beautiful and love almost everything else about it. Coming from a Lexus, I expected more reliability, but I'm hoping they'll find a solution for this frustrating issue. On the bright side, the car is super quiet and luxurious inside with user-friendly tech!",3
81,mercedes CLA Class,Technology and safety features are exceptional. Luxurious and sporty. Love my new vehicle.,3
85,mercedes GLS Class,"I traded my 2014 GL 450 for a 2017 GLS 550, and while the GL was great, the GLS is even more comfortable and offers a smoother ride. The front seats are an upgrade, and the rear space, with its lockable underfloor storage, is fantastic. I love the programmable driving modes and off-road package features. The GLS 550 has more power, and the 9-speed automatic transmission is smooth, though the ECO engine cutoff resets every time I start it, which is annoying. Overall, itâs a more comfortable and highway-friendly SUV than my Range Rover, but I wish the interior felt a bit more luxurious like the S-Class. At $100k, the GLS 450 might be a better value, but I enjoy the extra horsepower and features of the 550.",3
86,mercedes GLB Class,"I purchased the 2021 GLB for its compact size and third-row seating for kids, and I love its modern interior with turbine-style air vents and a sleek infotainment system, which I find easy to navigate despite some complaints. The large panoramic sunroof is a nice touch, though it's a pricey option. The engine is peppy, and it offers great gas mileage, but I do have a few annoyances: the second-row seats donât fold completely down when moved to the front, making access to the third row tricky, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay donât utilize the full 10.25-inch screen. While the GLB isnât the most stylish or performance-oriented SUV, it delivers on practicality, making it a solid choice alongside the Discovery Sport as a compact luxury SUV.",3
94,ford Fiesta,"I simply love this little car. It gets better mileage than any car I ever owned and is quiet, comfortable, handles very well and I think it is nice looking. It is not a hot rod but it will cruise at 80 MPH all day if you need to. It gets about 40 MPG on long drives at 60-65 MPH. It is a great value. It is a shame Ford is discontinuing it.",3
95,ford Focus,"I had a 2014 Ford Focus SE hatchback with a DCT auto transmission, which was great except for the problematic transmission. It hesitated, shuddered, jerked, and made clanging noises under the car, especially at slow speeds. This started after 5,000 to 7,000 miles and only got worse. I took it to Ford for repairs, but after a reprogram, it was even more problematic, and they admitted the shuddering was a known issue that couldn't be fully fixed. Frustrated, I traded it in at another dealership after receiving poor trade-in value from Ford, despite my history of spending on service and repairs. I switched to a Honda Civic and have had zero problems since, so do your homework if youâre considering the Focus.",2
98,ford EcoSport,"The Ecosport often gets low ratings for lack of power, poor gas mileage, and being more suited for city driving, but my experience has been quite the opposite. After driving it for 1,000 miles, I found no issues with power during normal driving, as the engine and transmission are smooth even at highway speeds of 75 mph, with no shaking or increased noise. The steering feels excellent, and I actually found the cabin more spacious than my old Fiesta. My fuel economy averaged 32.5 mpg mostly in town, thanks to a light foot and a seamless engine turn-off feature that didnât cause any shuddering at stops. Storage is great with fully folding rear seats. However, I was disappointed with the premium 10-speaker B&O sound system, which sounded tinny compared to my Hyundai Elantra's standard system. Upgrading the sound requires costly modifications, so I suggest saving your money and opting for the SE model instead if you want to replace the amp and speakers without hassle.",3
99,ford C-MAX,"First off, there are no tax credits available since it's not a plug-in, but I did check out the CMAX Energi. My first tank of gas lasted almost 600 miles, with an impressive average of 41 mpg. Parking is a breeze thanks to the standard backup camera, and there's plenty of comfort in both the front and back seats. The cargo space fits my traveling gym equipment, musical instruments, and several grocery bags, plus the retractable cover is handy for concealing my stuff. The vehicle handles really well, with quick responses to sudden steering changes and stable acceleration for merging or evasive maneuvers. I also appreciate the interior lighting around the key entrance and the turn signal lights on the rearview mirrors for extra visibility.",3
105,ford Edge,I have had this vehicle for less than a month. A better vehicle than my 2011 Edge. Interior is great with leather seats and a great radio. The acceleration is smooth and peppy. So far a SUV had met my expectations.,3
110,ford Mustang,"I shopped competitive convertibles: Jag FType, Audi S5, BMW M4. They are really nice cars with alot of character and potentially some challenging maintenance issues. The Mustang in my opinion is the best value by far. Gobs of power, great looks, excellent build quality and not overwhleming in the techy world of a BMW or a Audi. The Jag might have a better looking interior- but it also does not have a trunk, nor does the BMW. Key feature of the Mustang is the desing of the roof and the fact that I can fit 2 sets of golf bags in trunk with roof down. Not giant staff bags, but 2 sets of carry stand bags leaving the drivers in the bag! It is perfect.",3
112,ford Fusion,"Before this car, I had a 2012 Fusion, and it felt like everyone wanted to set their stuff on the deck lid or place their biscuits on the hood while waiting for meâthanks, Ford, for making that a little less achievable! I really like the new fuel door; it's a much better design than the capless system on my old model, which never sealed properly. The headlights also seem easier to replace, and the engine compartment has a decent amount of space to work in if I plan to keep it long-term. The computer is in the engine bay, which feels a bit cringe, but it's far enough from the engine that I don't think it'll be a problem. The battery is partially under the rain gutter, but it looks easy to slide out when it needs replacing. The suspension is great, as always, and this car stops on a dime! The trunk is cavernousâyou could probably fit 2-4 people back there! The back seat is comfortable, with sufficient legroom unless a tall person is sitting up front. The only downside is the floor mats; generic ones donât fit at all, so I need to find good ones and keep them forever.",3
113,ford Ranger,"I really really wanted to buy a Tacoma but my test drive was unimpressive. I found the Ford ranger to be much more responsive and smooth. The inside was also more comfortable although I did buy the lariat trim. The only negative is that so far the city mileage is about 18mpg. My first highway trip was 28 mpg, however so that was cool. Iâve been so impressed with the ranger, way beyond my expectations.",3
118,toyota Corolla,"I wanted a car that was cheap to own and fun to drive, and after having numerous Camaro SS models with the manual transmission, I found that this car, while lacking the monster torque and horsepower, still maintains the fun factor. The new chassis on the Corolla is excellent, offering just the right handlingâsoft but not too cushy, with good manners when driven. It has decent corner entry and, if you're in the right gear, a sweet corner exit. The interior surprised me; itâs much better than I expected, and I love the moonroof! I wouldn't even consider this car without a manual and the 2.0L engine. It's a great package for the money. The Miata felt overpriced for what it is, and the Civic seems weak to me. As an old hotrodder and road racer, I really enjoy this car as a daily driver. My only gripe is that the B-pillar between the front and rear door makes getting in and out a bit of a pain; my Camaro was easier to enter because the rear seat was about a foot behind the driver seat. Love it!",3
119,toyota RAV4,"I recently bought a 2022 Sienna and a RAV4 hybrid at the same time with my wife. While I find the Sienna very comfortable, the RAV4 is a different story. At 5'11"" and 240 pounds, I struggle with the cramped legroom caused by the 12-inch wide center consoleâit makes my legs feel confined. In contrast, the Sienna offers much more lateral space, measuring 24 inches between the console and door handle compared to 21 inches in the RAV4. My wife, who's 5'1"", is comfortable in the RAV4, but I recommend trying it out before purchasing, especially if you're taller. Both vehicles come with decent features, but the Sienna's console design, with extra drink holders and phone slots, definitely wins in practicality. The RAV4 hybrid has good acceleration and integrates well with Apple CarPlay, but I struggled to get the Toyota Scout GPS app working.",3
120,toyota Yaris,"Iâm really happy I chose the Yaris over the Chevy Sonic after owning it for a month. The interior feels high-quality for a subcompact, even if the center console is a bit flimsy. The controls are straightforward, and the center display screen is easy to use. Itâs super fun to driveâdefinitely not slow! With 106 hp and weighing just over 2400 lbs, it feels zippy, almost like a Miata sedan. Plus, the sound system is impressive, on par with my '03 Lexus, and Iâm averaging 43 mpg. I recommend going for the manual transmission, though it took me a bit to find a comfy driving position since I'm taller. Overall, I couldnât be happier!",3
123,toyota C-HR,Love it great features and great looks,4
124,toyota Prius,This is the third prius that we have owned,3
129,toyota Land Cruiser,Great vehicle which will outlast just about anything on the market. Only drawback is that is thirsty!,3
130,toyota Supra,"I bought the 2021 3.0 Premium without even test driving it, drawn in by its stunning silver look. I considered a new Corvette, but the pricing was crazy. I got this fully loaded model for $57k, and wow, itâs fastâfaster than my Mustang Boss 302! Itâs underrated at 382 hp, but Iâd say itâs closer to 410. The transmission is excellent; the sport mode shifts better than a manual unless you're really into shifting yourself. My only complaint is the silly horn that sounds like Peewee Herman's bike horn. The interior is comfy and nice, although getting in takes a bit of flexibility for taller folks. The handling in turns is amazing, the differential provides great traction, and itâs just a blast to drive. Definitely take it for a test rideâyouâll see what youâre missing. Itâs a real head-turner, and the day I drove it home was a great surprise!",3
131,toyota Camry,I live this car. It is comfortable to ride in - both front seats and back. There is very little road noise. Although I have the smaller engine it has plenty HP for what I need from a daily driver. Pano moon roof is a nice feature. The JBL stereo system is nice. As of now I have no complaints at all.,3
