2,audi A6,4.6,"I had looked at the Mercedes E Class, BMW 5 Series and the Lexus GS. I thought the Audi drove and handled better; and although a personal opinion, I liked the exterior and interior styling better than the other cars. I previously had a 2009 Audi A6 3.2 Quatro and I was planning on buying another 6 cylinder car. However, I was very surprised with the power of the 4 cylinder turbo and its?lack of NHV, so I bought a car with that engine in Quatro trim. I have not regretted buying the 4 cylinder car and found it to be more than adequate for my typical driving style and commute. Also, when I let friends drive the car, they are surprised it is not a 6 cylinder.","This car seems to eat oil. I bought this vehicle used with 33k miles on it from and audi dealership in peoria az in May of 2016. with in a week of owning it it was in the shop for the o2 sensor. Normal and under warranty so I didn't pay attention. Took it back in on October because i had had to put 2 quarts of oil through. Had an oil consumption study test done. Audi says oil consumption?of 1qt every 1.5k miles is normal and not a problem. Fast forward to Apr 2017, CEL came back on, took to dealership and the same o2 sensor was bad again. they couldn't fix it then due to recall filling up their garage. One week later while driving i hit the breaks hard and the car warning lights came on saying that it was out of oil. had to put 1 quart of oil in it right away and took back to dealership. They said it was 1.5 quarts low meaning that my car was 2.5 quarts low without any oil level warnings going off. This car has no dipstick and the oil is electronically monitored. Raised hell about oil consumption and they finally dig a diagnostic. My oil sensor was dead. They replaced it. May 2017 driving to work lost power and the car was stuttering. Took the car to another dealership in scottsdale. 4th cylinder ring failure, only able to hold compression of 35psi, replacing the engine. 48k miles and 2 months out of factory warranty. Audi won't do anything about it...looks bad for them. I bought my wife a q5 from the same dealership after i bought my a6. We traded in her q5 for a lexus nx200t as soon as we started having problems with the a6. So i have a car that bought with 33k miles on it and put 15k highway miles on it commuting in 1 year and the engine is blown and needs to be replaced. Pass on this vehicle. in fact run away.","I had a chance to test drive the 2012 Jag XF and the BMW 535 and 550. I opted out of Mercedes finding the styling of the E-class too uninspiring. the A6 which in my mind was perfect. The car is easy to maneuver at low speeds which the steering tightening up at higher speeds. The build quality is impeccable. The styling is more forward thinking than that of MB and Lexus. The LEDs set the car apart as does that Bang and Olufsen sound system. I found the Audi MMI very intuitive and actually fun to operate. The A6 3.0t is a fast engine with a transmission and chassis that makes it feel like the car is hardly working at high speeds. Plain and simple, it puts a smile on my face every day.

I can get 30mpg on highway cruising to work around 70mph Interior is amazing and infotainment is great Exhaust sound doesnÂft wear you out Brakes are rock solid Cons: Dynamic mode is rough on the roads in St Louis. Could have more aggressive sound but itÂfs a V6 and IÂfm SICK of people always saying but itÂfs not a V8 and doesnÂft sound good. EVERYONE knows a V8 sounds better. Stop beating a dead horse with this. I knew this when I bought the car. If you have ever owned a car that has loud exhaust, you will admit there are times when it can get a little old when just cruising around (rarely but does happen) Absolutely no aftermarket performance parts are available in the US yet Transmission can be a little slow to downshift even in dynamic mode Now for my complaints with other reviews: Magazines want to compare this to the M4 and C63 which are RWD and they all say but it doesnÂft have the fun factor blah blah blah. IÂfm 40. I donÂft need to do a burn out around every corner and maybe when driven at 10/10 on a track, those might beat the RS5. When driven at ANYTHING less than that and on any street in America, the RS5 is safer and will destroy those cars and more especially from a launch with the AWD. I have raced a hellcat and embarrassed it. People buy Audis partly for the stealth aspect of them. There are a lot of people that donÂft need to be flashy and loud all the time. What this car does is murder the competition without making a big deal about it. Audi buyers donÂft have to have all eyes on them and say Âglook at me!Âh Like every BMW driver. Finally, if you want a sports coupe that is fast, solid, safe and not flashy, the RS5 is your car. If you want to live on a race track only, get the M4. If you want to have an awesome exhaust note and buy new tires every month from your daily burnouts, get the C63","IÂfve been driving BMWs for 15 years and this was my first Audi! It has surpassed ALL expectation! The seats are extremely comfortable. The drive modes provide a wide range of comfort and performance. If your more into a Lexus type ride, the comfort mode provides that while performance and handling under dynamic makes you feel youÂfre on the autobahn! I only wish I had bought one years ago! ","I traded my 2017 S6 in for the RS5 Sportback as I wanted something more sporty. The S6 was great but a little two big and unwieldy for sporty driving. Overall I am happy with the RS5. It is a good size, looks fantastic and has excellent performance and handling. The AWD makes it a year round daily drive in the Northeast, something the M4/C63/Giulia Quadrifolglio do not offer at least for now. The AWD is not the only feature that makes it more practical as a daily; the hatchback (sorry, sportback) makes it easy to load and unload large items. Also the ride comfort is significantly more tolerable than the competitors. With 19"" wheels the ride is just as comfortable as an A4. I went with the base 19"" wheels for a few reasons; cost, better ride, less weight, better looks (subjective), less likelihood of a /bent wheel, and better traction when equipped with winter tires. The ride/handling tradeoff is perfect with the 19s and Dynamic Package (DRC suspension). I leave the suspension is auto as it is not as bouncy as comfort but not as stiff as dynamic. The drivetrain is great as well but the engine could use a bit more character. It pulls hard and there is good power everywhere. Turbo lag is not bad but you do feel it for a split second when flooring it. The engine sound is not terrible but it is one of the few negative points about the driving experience. The C63 sounds much better, while the M4 sounds only slightly better. The 8 speed automatic is a great transmission. It upshifts and downshifts quickly and smoothly in comfort and auto while dynamic makes the shifts even quicker and more forceful.Having said that a dual clutch transmission would be even better and make the car more special as everyone seems to be using the same ZF 8 speed automatic now. Coincidentally Porsche uses this same engine in the Macan turbo with a dual clutch (PDK) so it's a shame Audi doesn't do the same. Gas mileage is unsurprisingly poor but the worst part is the range. With the small gas tank I am getting around 240 miles per tankful which is awful. The car desperately needs a larger tank. The interior quality and design are excellent as you would expect from Audi. Fit and finish is perfect and the material quality is outstanding. The seats are comfortable all day. The massage feature is a bit lame as it uses deflating/inflating air bladders instead of actual motors like it the A8. Instead they should offer comfort seats for people that want really comfortable seats with real massage. The virtual cockpit is cool but I would be fine with a traditional gauge cluster. The infotainment/nav screen is just stuck on the dash, not integrated like newer designs, and it doesn't even retract. I wish the moon roof was optional. It adds weight and comes with a retractable perforated screen that blocks most but not all of the sun. Plus when open the glass roof retracts outside of the car. I would have paid $1000 to delete the moon roof. Audi: make the moon roof an option. Another gripe about the interior is the glaring lack of storage compartments. There is very little space to store small items. Another storage issue: the owner's manual get stowed in the hatchback area, and the jack get strapped to the floor of the cargo area instead of in a cubby. Weird. Other than the few minor gripes I still feel it is the best vehicle in it's segment. Yes the others have slightly better track times and acceleration numbers but in the real world the RS5 is right there with them. Throw is wet or slippery roads and you can't even use 1/4 of the performance of the others. Even if the others had AWD I will still take the Audi. The M4 styling looks ridiculous, designed by a Fast and Furious attitude in mind. Plus the ride is harsh. The Alfa can be dismissed due to its abysmal reliability and poor interior quality. The C63 is nice but it rides firms and looks too similar to a C300/C43; not acceptable when paying $80k. Also the MCT transmission shifts very harsh. In summary, if you are looking for a practical everyday performance sedan/hatchback that delivers the goods, and does not beat you up, the RS5 is the only choice","I have now had this car for a year and give you an accurate real world review, not the stupid reviews that every car magazine will give you Pros: Very fast Comfortable when not in dynamic mode.

Actually, it is a known issue and Audi has no ETA on resolution... 2. Also, what Audi does not tell you, is that Premium trim does not come with ConnectPrime ($365/yr) or ConnectPlus ($499/yr), and owner cannot buy these packages. However, you will have the privilege to buy ""functions on demand"" ConnectPlus + Nav for a ""small fee"" of $900/yr.

37,bmw i3,4.4,"We have had short-lease ownership of both a 2017 and a 2018 model, They are virtually identical, with the main difference being that the 2017 did not have the backup camera. From 2018 on, all i3's now have the integrated camera, and it is a good one. Now that the lease is up on the 2017 model, we got a nice promotional offer from a New England dealer, and took them up on it. So, we?will now have a 2019 model, with the larger battery pack. Obviously we enjoy the car. It is particularly fun and zippy around town. Highway driving is okay, but sketchy on days when there is a strong crosswind. This car is not for everybody, of course. But none of our routine drives are more than 75 miles, and we have a level 2 charger in our garage at home. As an experiment, I once drove round-trip 650 miles in one day, to visit my daughter at college, using frequent gas fillups. This is not ideal, but it is possible, if you don't want to find chargers. Try driving a Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf 650 miles in 13 hours. People get hung up on the list price of the car. As if that is what you really have to pay. The pundits don't seem to grasp that virtually nobody BUYS a new i3. The lease deals are too attractive. With some effort, you can lease one for less than $300 per month. Particularly if you are buying at the end of the model year. You have the option of ""buying out"" the car at the end of the lease, but I suspect that nobody does that, either, because the pre-determined 'residual value' is set at an artificially high level, in order to decrease the monthly lease payments. These are fun cars. But because they are so fun to drive, the tires will wear out. if that bothers you, stay away from this car. It is a very odd tire size, and no other car on the planet uses that size. As a consequence, there is only one company that manufactures that tire size for all-season tires. (there are two other companies that make winter tires for the i3, but only in the 19"" rim size). At first, when I realized I might have to buy new tires on the 2017 that I turned in, with about 18000 miles, I was a tad upset. But then I realized that it is a high-performance car, and the rear-wheel drive dynamics do put a lot of stress on the rear tires. In the end, the dealer who accepted the car at the end of the lease commented on the worn rear tires, but let it pass, ultimately. And I am okay with buying new tires, if I have to. And I will be putting on Nokain R3 winter tires on my 2018 this winter, both for winter safety, but also to save the tread on the summer tires. Again if you hate buying tires, and you want to own this car, then drive gently, corner reasonably, and avoid jack-rabbit starts. Hard things for me to do. If you test drive this car, you will want one. I have now ""test driven"" over 20K miles, and I am sold. It is an electric car 98% of the time. But it has neutralized range anxiety with the backup gasoline power. I rarely use gas, but it's nice to know that I can. That beats a Chevy Bolt or a Nissan Leaf, as far as I'm concerned. And it comes pretty close to beating a Tesla, from range-anxiety point of view. ======================================= I do live in an area with a handful of available high-amperage DC chargers. These will fully charge a depleted battery in about 40 minutes. But most owners charge at home, or at work, if they are lucky enough to have an enlightened employer. ======================================== Buying a used i3 REX is a totally valid option. They all have warranties out to 48 months, and the first 36 months includes free dealer service, including inspection stickers. So any car that you will find has been well maintained (though you will want to do your own due diligence on that). The gas engine requires an oil change about once a year, if it is used at all. The battery and electric powertrain should last ten years or more, without being touched. You just have to keep up with tires, wiper blades, and changing the hydraulic brake fluiid every couple of year. But if you are buying used, be aware of the battery size. The battery size has jumped every two years of production. And be sure to get a backup camera. You can tell if a used car has a backup camera in the dealer's photos, because the little fish-eye is in the middle of the bumper. And rumor has it that BMW will stop making these in a year or two. And it seems likely that they will not increase the battery size beyond what is is now (2019 and 2020 model years) It is a unique car, remarkably quiet inside, remarkably good ride, considering it is a small car. Remarkably tight turning radius. I can make a U-turn in places were no other car could possibly do it. Even if you never own one, you should make an effort to drive one. It is unique.","I've had my 2015 i3 Rex for a little over a year now. Others have pretty well covered the high quality of materials and how much fun the car is to drive. I'll comment more specifically on the REX engine. BMW is the ONLY electric car to include such a thing. Every other plug-in hybrid includes a full-size engine to drive the wheels when you're out of power. All that weight and complexity leaves very little room for a decent-sized battery. BMW built the i3 as an electric car first, and added the range extender for even more capability. I live in a medium-sized town, and typically am able to stay within my electric range. When I travel to neighboring towns, however, I almost always kick in the little REX engine on the highway, allowing me to save my electricity for city driving. This is an important point - in the United States, the car is programmed (""coded,"" in BMW-speak) so that the REX engine won't come on until you're down to your last few miles of electricity. It was originally designed, however, for you to be able turn on the REX engine at will below 75% charge, and works that way in Europe. It's easy to re-code it to the European specs (search You Tube) and turns it into a MUCH more useful car. I took my i3 on a 250-mile trip to a large city today, and although I had to stop about every hour to fill up the tiny gas tank, I was able to make the trip with ease and always had plenty of electricity to use when I needed it. In short, the range extender + recoding turns it into a REAL car if you want to use it that way. ","The BMW i3 has character, style, and class. ItÂfs most certainly never boring. YouÂfd think with its small stature that my 6Âf2Âh frame would feel cramped inside, but not so. This is true even in the back seat, which is easy to access via the suicide doors. Upon delivery there was a fit and finish issue that the dealer quickly corrected. (A wire got caught in front of the speaker in the door and was vibrating.) I also experienced a puncture in my flat tire at fewer than 200 miles. Thankfully the dealership went above and beyond and replaced it at no cost. As an added bonus for those who have range anxiety, BMW has provided two years of free charging at ChargePointÂfs network of fast charging stations. (Most in my area seem to be found at Whole Foods Market.) My local dealership also has a program where you can drop off your i3 when youÂfre going on a longer trip and theyÂfll give you a loaner running on gasoline. I highly recommend getting the Technology & Driving Assistant Package. The updated iDrive display is definitely worth it, as the base display looks sad. The package also comes with convenient features like adaptive cruise control. Love this car and do not regret my purchase one iota.

I have 5000 miles on it now. It is a FANTASTIC car. It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first?week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 & 1 to Santa Monica that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!! For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation. I've lowered the car 3/4"" front and back. Put Niche rims on and went to 305's on the back from the stock 285's. It is one....... Sweet.........car. My 2 business partners have opted for coupes. One got his this week. The other is headed to Munich next week to enjoy a European delivery. He will drive his around Europe for a couple weeks then BMW will ship it home. We each have our own specific tastes in the car. BMW offers a wide range of color combinations. If you can afford the car, you will not be disappointed","I bought this car with 5 miles on the odometer so I might have been the 1st person to take a test drive. This was a little surprising as the car was on the lot for about 6 weeks. The new 2018s were being delivered starting April 1 and I got my car on April 7 with a huge discount. It runs perfectly, has great comfort, power, handling and overall smoothness you would expect in a car listed at $90k. Most surprisingly is the good gas mileage around 21.5 mixed driving on premium gas.The top works flawlessly... with the provided rear wind screen when the top is down you do not have any in car turbulence. You can talk in a normal voice and listen to the radio w/o any extra volume (although it adjusts to your speed). Surprisingly the windscreen does away with any wind in the front 2 seats but does take away the back seat.

The technology is superior with things like Apple Car Play, very smart bright lights, cruise control, fuel consumption, various programmed driving modes, excellent wet road handling, etc. So awesome car that seriously need slightly wider tires on the rear. I have had my 2016 M4 convertible (with competition package) since the middle of May (it is now the end of August). I have 5000 miles on it now. It is a FANTASTIC car. It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first?week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 & 1 to Santa Monica that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!! For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation. I've lowered the car 3/4"" front and back. Put Niche rims on and went to 305's on the back from the stock 285's. It is one....... Sweet.........car. My 2 business partners have opted for coupes. One got his this week. The other is headed to Munich next week to enjoy a European delivery. He will drive his around Europe for a couple weeks then BMW will ship it home. We each have our own specific tastes in the car. BMW offers a wide range of color combinations. If you can afford the car, you will not be disappointed I bought this car with 5 miles on the odometer so I might have been the 1st person to take a test drive. This was a little surprising as the car was on the lot for about 6 weeks. The new 2018s were being delivered starting April 1 and I got my car on April 7 with a huge discount. It runs perfectly, has great comfort, power, handling and overall smoothness you would expect in a car listed at $90k. Most surprisingly is the good gas mileage around 21.5 mixed driving on premium gas.The top works flawlessly... with the provided rear wind screen when the top is down you do not have any in car turbulence. You can talk in a normal voice and listen to the radio w/o any extra volume (although it adjusts to your speed). Surprisingly the windscreen does away with any wind in the front 2 seats but does take away the back seat. The trunk as a unique loading system but if you are taking any long trips it can only hold 1 suitcase.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9991}",0.9991,5

43,bmw Z4,4.0,"My wife has always wanted a blue convertible roadster with a tan interior and after many years of waiting she decided to get a 2022 Z4 sDrive 30i in Mediterranean Blue Metallic with Cognac Leather with the Convenience and Premium Level Two packages. She did not opt for the sports handling package. This was her purchase and she did the research with a few suggestions by me along the way.?I wasn't sure what to expect so I was pleasantly surprised when I got behind the wheel. Most driving enthusiast sites tout the sDrive 40i with the more powerful engine along with the M version, improved handling, bigger tires, etc...as the way to go. However, I have been very happy with this car. We aren't ever going to take it to the track nor are we looking to push it to the extreme limits of its capabilities. The 4 cylinder 255 horsepower engine offers plenty of power and torque and the car is nicely balanced with the lighter front end due to the smaller engine. The car is refined and the seats are very comfortable. The trunk is larger than I would have expected and the sound proofing is very good. Usually, driving a convertible with the top up is a noisy and unpleasant experience but that is not the case with the Z4. This car could be a legitimate daily driver for most of the year. We got it in the middle of December after waiting 4 months for it to be built. Knowing that my wife would want to drive it on nicer winter days, I swapped out the summer tires for a set of all season Goodyear Eagles and we'll switch them back when the weather warms up in the Spring. Pluses - refined ride - fun to drive - comfortable seats - high quality interior - excellent infotainment system with a bit of a learning curve - quick and responsive without being dangerously fast - again we're looking to have fun on twisty roads, not to break lap records - 8 Speed Automatic Transmission is fantastic - very quick and smooth - Excellent Gas Mileage - especially on the highway. Minuses - BMW upgrades can add up quickly - requires Premium Fuel (no real surprise) - Steering - its electronic so it feels a bit like a video game - brakes are grabby at low speeds so they require some delicate feathering - visibility isn't great with the top up - Minimal storage in the cabin but hey - its a convertible two seater so this isn't a shocker. Overall - she loves the car and I am impressed, it is fun on twisty roads but very comfortable for longer trips with a trunk that allows for weekend getaways and trips to the grocery store, it could be legitimate daily driver.",,,"My wife has always wanted a blue convertible roadster with a tan interior and after many years of waiting she decided to get a 2022 Z4 sDrive 30i in Mediterranean Blue Metallic with Cognac Leather with the Convenience and Premium Level Two packages.

I have owned many including Corvettes, Trans Ams, Z28s, Mustangs, and MG Midgets, but this one takes the cake. Although I still own a 1970 Corvette (rarely driven these days), I still lust for the fun per mile that my Z3 delivered. My wife and I were looking for a sports car for my fortieth birthday back in 2005 and stumbled onto this Atlanta Blue 2.8 5 speed with tan interior. One test drive and the rest is history! The performance, economy, power, looks, and driving pleasure makes this my most fun since my old MGs (when they were running properly). I owned this car for five flawless years and drove the he'll out of it.  I have wanted this car since I saw it in GoldenEye and the deal I got was just too good to pass up. It had only 29,000 mi on it when I bought it and everything in all the reviews that drivers had issues with had already been fixed (her father owned a BMW dealership) so it was perfect.

52,hyundai Tucson,4.0,"I'm a long time Toyota guy and for the most part, their vehicles have not disappointed over the years. We recently went on the search for a new compact SUV and looked at the Rav4 Prime, CR-V Touring Hybrid, and the new Tucson Limited here in the US (both hybrid and non versions). 2021 Rav4 Prime - In fairness to the Rav4 Prime we tested, it just came off the truck when we drove it and?it was not charged. So, it drove like a gas hybrid and only saw spurts of performance as a result of the regen. The ride was Ok, performance was adequate, road noise was a bit on the high side, and the interior just seemed dated and pieced together. 2021 CR-V Touring Hybrid - was impressive in almost all respects except the road noise during highway driving was significant. The infotainment system was a bit clutsy as well. Otherwise, it seemed quite refined and was our top choice at the time. But, we decided to wait for the 2022 Tucson (glad we did). 2022 Tucson Limited (gas version) - refined and does most things very well, but the performance is average. 2022 Tucson Limited Hybrid - Wow! What a difference between the two new Tucson models. Put this Hybrid into Sport Mode and it is fun to drive, simply leaving the others in the dust in terms of performance (no practical person would need more acceleration than this (it's not Tesla quick, but as quick as most would drive a Tesla). As for all other aspects, the Tucson Hybrid is hard to beat in almost every category. The interior is fantastic in all respects with the exception of the piano black and touchscreen controls that look nice now but likely a dust-collecting annoyance down the road. There are a few downsides to note: 1) no spare tire and that IMO is a significant oversight by Hyundai since it appears there's room for at least a donut spare. 2) for some reason that Hyundai won't publicly address, the 10.25 Infotainment screen on the higher end models does not support ""wireless"" Apple CarPlay and AndroidAuto (only wired support). However, that wireless feature is available on the lower end trims. So hopefully, there's a firmware update for this deficiency. We bought the Hybrid Limited in White w/ gray interior and couldn't be happier. I honestly don't know why Hyundai is even bothering making the gas version, given the small price difference. We did consider waiting for the PHEV version, but, liked this hybrid version so much we jumped on it. A few things to note on the Limited trim: the wipers are rain sensing and the passenger seat is full electric including up & down functions. The safety and tech on this vehicle is nearly insane and will take you some time to digest it all. Impressive. One other thing to note, all of the electrified versions of the Tucson (hybrid included) are made in Ulsan, South Korea (VIN beginning with ""K""). Comparing the fit and finish of the Tucson's from the Alabama plant vs the Korea plant show better refinement on those rolling off the Ulsan assembly line, at least by my eyes as inspecting the reveal tolerances between body panels at my dealership. Given the tech, safety features, comfort, and performance of the new Tucson Hybrid, it's certainly worth the test drive if considering this class of SUV. If reliability proves positive over time, this Tucson is a game-changer in this class and hopefully inspires my friends at Toyota to significantly step up their game.","I recently purchased a 2022 Tucson SEL Premium. This is my household's third Tucson; we had a 2017 SE and currently have a 2021 Value Edition. There are three notable differences (not counting the difference in appearance) compared to previous model years. First and maybe most important is the 2.5L engine. Finally this SUV has a suitable sized engine. The 2.0L that previously powered?the Tucson underwhelming to say the least. While he 2.5L isn't going to put you back in your seat, it's going to get the job done merging onto the highway or pulling out in fast moving traffic. Second, the seats are far more comfortable than they've been in the past. Next to the underpowered engine of past model years, this was my biggest complaint. I don't know if Hyundai is doing focus groups but they must have been made aware of the seats because they've addressed them. I couldn't imagine a long road trip in the front seats prior to the 2022 but now I'm looking forward to them. Third, the backseat passengers got some leg room. If I'm not mistake the wheelbase is slightly longer this year and that extra length was gifted to backseat passengers. We have a few six footers in the family and packed a couple in the back seat this past weekend. There were no complaints, something we heard plenty of in the past. This one upgrade from previous model years really puts the Tucson up against it's larger sibling, the Sante Fe. I can't see spending more money on the Sante Fe at this point.

57,hyundai Ioniq,4.2,"This is our first electric vehicle and what a great surprise. I ordered it without test driving it first - which was strange but decided to take the risk and it was well worth it. As with everything there are pros and cons and these are my main take-aways after driving it for almost 2 weeks. Pros: -The driving comfort is just superb. The suspension is the best that I have been in by far. You, do not, feel, the bumps. Period. -The seats were also the best I have encountered (I drove it in the highway for more than 13 hours). -You can customize almost any setting to your preference: from the interior light color, to the safety features. And technology feels balanced with practicality -The combination of power, breaking (or, removing your foot off the accelerator, I should say) and the quite interior, are better than I ever expected. -The interior feels (and is) bigger than it seems from outside with good quality materials in general. Cons: -Driving at high constant speeds (aka, the highway) will lower your mileage range per charge -Driving in cold temperatures (and I mean driving in the 40s or below) will also lower the range -The combination of the two above, are almost lethal to the battery. I was getting more like 150 miles per battery charge driving in the highway with temps between 37 - 45 F and average speed of 80 miles/hr. when the best range is 260 miles or so for the AWD models. -We have three little kids and while they fit in the back seat, it is very tight to fit three car seats, booster seats, or the combination of the two. -For some reason, the car did not come with floor mats, including for the back/truck area. I called the local Hyundai dealer to see if I can buy some and they said that they may be in stock three months from now. Is it only me or it is strange that mats are not sold at the same time as the car, or with the car? -Visibility to the exterior is important to me when backing up and the visibility is not terrible but not good, however, there is a bird's eye camera view you can see on the screen in the dashboard that shows with detail the surroundings and your proximity that easily makes-up for the poorer visibility (this view comes in automatically when you shift to reverse) Overall I think this vehicle is amazing and depending on your specific needs and situation, it could very well be the ideal vehicle.",,,"This is our first electric vehicle and what a great surprise.

I have the GLE 350 4matic and while the engine doesn't sound pleasant, the performance is on-par and worth it for better efficiency.

I noticed reviews saying that your pant legs would get dirty when you get in the car; I have this issue too. I feel exceptionally safe in this SUV and love the driver's assistance package. I do wish there was a quicker way to disable the active lane departure warning (it's quite aggressive and disturbs the otherwise exceptional ride.) The active driving assistance (and active lane change assist) make highway driving so easy. The traffic jam assist gets too close to cars for my comfort, but otherwise works as expected. The 360 camera isn't as good as Audi/BMW but it's better than any mainstream brand and I find it very helpful. I tried the automated parallel parking feature twice and it parks as well (or as poorly) as the vehicles you park in-between.

72,mercedes GLA Class,4.2,"I have been driving the GLA250 for about a half year. Absolutely no problems. It was parked outside in last year's Boston extreme winter and drove in the snow and ice like a champion. The car is a delight to drive. Fast with average 26 mpg (90% city, 30-31 mpg on highway at brisk speeds). I find the GLA a beautiful design and I received many compliment for it (often from Europeans who?value the practical hatchbacks more than US drivers). What I don't enjoy is the wind noise on the highway, the very little leg room in the back and the low roof line at the front (I am 6'2"")....but all those are compensated well by overall joy driving this car. I tested the BMW X1 and Audi Q3. Nothing changed after a year and a half. The car goes to a Mercedes dealer's service once a year. In between only gas and windshield washer tanks need fill up. Not even the tires needed air since I bought the car. (Here I had a line that claimed that the transmission settings were updated but I was wrong. It was wishful thinking. Sadly.) I had no technical problems in the first two years. UPDATE: Two and a half years of driving the GLA250 the car had no problem whatsoever. The single thing I am very unhappy about is the transmission's ECO mode. That is rather bad for a Mercedes. In the city (especially at slow cornering) the downshifting is delayed and abrupt. It shifts from 3 to 2 with a sudden jerk and unpleasant jump in gear2. The other shortcoming is - what many complained about - is the tendency of shifting into gear 7 also in ECO at ~ 35 mph which is annoying. The 2016 model has multiple gear options (e.g. comfort) but Mercedes won't bother to make the 2015 models any better by updating the software. This is such a disappointment in this otherwise great car that I am considering trading it in soon for a different brand. YEAR THREE UPDATE: See that for my initial impressions of the GLA250 above. Now the car turned three years old. Still running beautifully. The engine is superb. The transmission as annoying as ever and it was pointed out by a large number of reviewers. MB still does not bother upgrading the shifting properties. That is poor customer support especially because so many of us requested it. I took the car for the third annual service and they told me I need new tires. The car ran only 17500 miles and the Bridgestone Duellers are worn out on the front wheels (not sure whther they rotated them or not). They wanted to sell me that same junk tires again. What more, the Bridgestones come with NO WARRANTY (except defects). No minimum mileage, nothing. This is MB OEM quality and a $40k car. Last time I encountered this kind of tire ""warranty"" was my parents Russian Lada in the 1970s. If Mercedes thinks that this is their entry level car and people will buy higher class Benzes they ought to make a better impression. THREE + HALF YEAR UPDATE: I replaced those low quality Bridgestone tires with non-runflat Continentals. I bought a Mercedes donut spare wheel that I keep it in the trunk. Guess what? The trunk became so small (with the wheel in it) that a Porsche 911 may have more storage space. No technical issues. MB recalled it for an airbag grounding that was done on 30 minutes as promised. Herb Chambers' MB service is great. I can not say the same about Herb Chambers' sales. They can not confirm that I purchased an extended warranty for the car in 2015 and want me to buy that again. I asked them to check the warranty but they did not bother to respond. The 2019 facelift looks attractive. Since the BMW X2 is a massively ugly version of the double-boring X1 I may stick to the GLA and consider trading mine for the 2019 model. But first I check out the transmission :-)","I got the sea blue and boy does it turn heads. Its my first automatic in years, which is a bit of a bummer because off the starting line it can be less than exciting. The Sport mode changes everything quickly- i love it. Gas mileage on highways is superb, gas mileage through the town is just ok. I really like the car a lot, and I adore it's looks. I wish the nav didn't misunderstand?every single thing I say- it makes it easy less convenient than just talking to Siri on my iPhone through bluetooth. I wouldn't pay for that next time. Back seat isn't perfect, but you don't buy a car this size hoping for a giant backseat. I really find myself paddle shifting more than I expected, and I really like the sunroof and stereo quality. The climate is almost too cold. Great color.

Looked at the Porsche Macan but the price with options and the wait time seemed outrageous and then add the maintenance cost and the fact that it rides like a truck ... I looked at the new Lexus NX but the lack of power and handling seemed weak at best. Same thing with the Q3.

77,mercedes E Class,4.8,"This beautiful car was delivered to me directly from Germany. Brand new from the factory. Ordered it loaded with options; all leather interior, wood and leather steering wheel, ventilated seats, Burmester sound system etc. The first thing that was pointed out to me by the dealership was the scratch on the hood. Yes, there was a scratch that happened during shipping. I wasn't pleased but of course they're going to fix it. Upon arriving at home with the new car I noticed that the driver's seat did not move back and the seatback actually pushed me forward into the steering wheel when I turned the car off. I was shocked when this happened, as the seatback angle was quite extremely angled toward the wheel. I worked with the ""easy enter/exit"" settings to no avail. This thing was malfunctioning no matter what I did. The car has been to the dealership twice for this problem and it is STILL not fixed. I finally gave up and turned off the enter/exit function. So now I have to manually slide the seat back when getting in and out of the car. The seat memory function seems to be working now although it was initially hit and miss. Despite the glitches in this new car, I think it's beautiful and I love almost everything else about it. I am still hoping that a solution will be found for this annoying problem. Having driven a Lexus for 7 years prior to the Mercedes, I was used to reliability and perfection. Never expected a new car, especially a Mercedes, to have problems like this.

My lease was up on my 2018 S450 so I decided on the E450 4MATIC Sedan. I picked it up on May 4th, 2020. What a car! The first noticeable attribute was the razor sharp cornering and handling with unbelievable acceleration and power. The responsiveness of the car to driver input is phenomenal. My car is fully loaded with Driver's Assistance, Exterior Lighting, Parking Assistance, AMG, Premium, Panorama Roof, 19"" AMG Wheels/Tires Packages. Impressive array of technology coupled with a smart phone app that provides huge amounts of data about the vehicle (Mercedes Me Connect). I love this car! Seats are comfortable and visibility outstanding. It is quieter than one would think for a 362 hp twin turbo V6 engine and performance all season run flat tires. Audio system is terrific with HD AM/FM tuning as well as Apple Car Play for hands-free control over music. The styling is more like a baby S Class Sedan with LED front and rear lights. I recommend a test drive in an E350 and then an E450 to truly appreciate the superiority of the E450 4MATIC (AWD). This is truly a vehicle made for a driver who appreciates a car that fits like a glove. I have owned this car for 7 months now and have 3900 miles on the odometer. I have not had to bring the car in to the service department in all these months except to change windshield wipers that tend to ÂgchatterÂh in heavy, consistent rain. The problem remains to be a nuisance to me, but there are no satisfactory solutions to this problem after many visits to service to alleviate this annoying anomaly. The vehicle remains to be the best handling and most powerful car I have ever owned. The technology and safety features have kept me out of potentially dangerous situations such as backing out of a parking space and having the car brake automatically when an oncoming car or pedestrian approaches from the left or right rear of the car. The blind spot monitors have worked impeccably when on the interstate or on local highways. The advanced technology requires a tremendous learning curve to master (about 2-3 weeks) due to the various settings and adjustments, however well worth the time and patience as the results are amazing. The maneuverability of the car is truly awesome - it quickly responds to driver input and manages its way beautifully in heavy traffic. Acceleration is outstanding with the bi-turbo 362 hp V6 engine. Accessing the many technical and audio features via the controller or voice activation is well appreciated as is the advanced GPS system. In summary, I continue to enjoy this vehicle immensely.

The technology and safety features have kept me out of potentially dangerous situations such as backing out of a parking space and having the car brake automatically when an oncoming car or pedestrian approaches from the left or right rear of the car. The blind spot monitors have worked impeccably when on the interstate or on local highways. The advanced technology requires a tremendous learning curve to master (about 2-3 weeks) due to the various settings and adjustments, however well worth the time and patience as the results are amazing. The maneuverability of the car is truly awesome - it quickly responds to driver input and manages its way beautifully in heavy traffic. Acceleration is outstanding with the bi-turbo 362 hp V6 engine. Accessing the many technical and audio features via the controller or voice activation is well appreciated as is the advanced GPS system. In summary, I continue to enjoy this vehicle immensely.

85,mercedes GLS Class,4.2,"Traded in my 2014 GL 450 for the 2017 GLS 550. The GL was the best SUV that I have owned (Range Rover, Navigator, Yukon Denali XL). On the surface the GLS seemed to be very similar, but I have found it to be more comfortable with an even better ride. The seat comfort (in the front) is a step up from the GL. Operating this SUV is a pleasurable experience akin to driving a large automobile. I don't need the third row seats as often as I did (kids are grown), but the rear space is fantastic. I especially like the lockable under floor storage in the rear. The programmable driving modes are a nice feature as is the steering assistant. I also got the off-road package this time with the extra height adjustment and the low-range feature. This gives you some undercarriage protection and low-end torque that the standard 4 matic does not have. The 550 has quite a bit more power than the 450 did. The 9 speed automatic transmission is very smooth. The technology is great however, the ECO engine cutoff is automatically activated even time you start the vehicle, or when changing the driving mode. If you dislike this feature, you have to remember to manually de-activate it every time you start up. The interior has been upgraded a bit, but still needs to be more like the S-Class. Although the new center screen is bright and easy to read. GL's was a bit small. It is more at home on the highway than my Range Rover was and more comfortable. It's too early to tell about the reliability yet, but my previous GL was outstanding in that department. With the cost at around $100k, the GLS 450 is probably a better value. The 550 represents about $20k worth of extra horsepower, leather seating and bells & whistles. If I still had kids to haul around, I would have gotten another 450.","I have been using this SUV past 3 years. Here is my experience. Past 3 years enjoyed driving the SUV for all errands, road trips. It is great to drive with family. Driving comfort for long journey is great for all passengers. The SUV is able to maintain a quiet cabin and driving experience is amazing and stress free. Improvements with Apple Car play let us avoid the not so friendly Merc Navigation. Reason for 3 start Review There is no lighting package in this SUV and it was not in my shopping list thought that car will be fine with out fancy headlights. Never imagined my investment went to wrong route. The headlights are so dim that i had to rely on other vehicles bright headlights. Driivng in rain or fog is out of question. I rather take my other vehicle or rent than relying on this vehicle. I ended up into close accidents in bad weather situations. I reported to Mercedes, Dealers, NHA and ended up no luck and the Friendly answer from Merc that you have the lights that is what you have to use. i decided to go for after market and planning to go for alternate. Note- if you are buying without a lighting package, give a second thought. The following features are must to get best out of Mercedes. Driver Assistance Package Lighting Package Improvements needed - No Music Track change option on steering wheel, have to rely on multi-function button. No wireless charging pad or space for keeping phones. Need some space improvements. Access to 3 rd row is not friendly. ","I have been driving the new GLS 450 for 2 months. I used to drive a Cadillac CTS and this new Truck gives me a similar driving experience (except that I don't want to do a quick/sharp turn) and sometimes it even gives me even more confidence in handling. It is very spacious; I keeps the 3rd row folded during most of time and carried lots of stuff in the truck (e.g. two large palm trees!). The interior is also very good for the price. The only major downside is the information system: if I had it 10 years ago I would probably have liked it lot, but in the year of 2016, this system is way too old fashioned. The information does not even have a TOUCH SCREEN! Instead, it uses a gigantic control knob with technology already invented in the 90's. Furthermore, some of the common controls are hard to find (e.g. turning on/off bluetooth) - one should be able to push a button to do it. If you connect your phone to the car via bluetooth, it can be very very annoying, so does the AirPlay feature, because the car will stop the music for any notification coming from your phone. And only two USB ports? Overall, I still like to drive this car without its old-fashioned information system, but I hope Mercedes can improve it in the next model - after all, if I could just replace that screen with my iPad, it would give me a much better information system already.","Traded in my 2014 GL 450 for the 2017 GLS 550.

86,mercedes GLB Class,4.4,"Purchased the 2021 GLB because I was looking for a compact-sized SUV with third row seating for kids. The GLB also has a modern interior, I like the turbine-style air vents and the ""surfboard"" infotainment and instrument cluster. Despite what others have said about navigating the infotainment, I don't find it hard or cumbersome to use. However, one nuisance is having to scroll to the?radio presets every now and then on the instrument display, sometimes it doesn't save the last setting. I also like the large panoramic sunroof although that's a $1500 option. The engine is peppy and the car is nimble (for an SUV) and has great class gas mileage. There are a few annoyances though: 1) The 2nd row seats don't fold all the way down IF the seats are moved to the front most position (the headrest hits the front seats), this makes it even more difficult to climb into the 3rd row; 2) Android Auto and Apply Carplay doesn't take up the full 10.25 inch infotainment screen, Google Maps only displays 7 inches. Hopefully Mercedes will update it to fill the screen. The GLB isn't very stylish, isn't very fast and performance-oriented, and it's not the most luxurious Mercedes; however it offers the perfect practicality. The only competitor is the Discovery Sport which is also a compact, luxury SUV with a third row.","Purchased the 2021 GLB because I was looking for a compact-sized SUV with third row seating for kids.

95,ford Focus,2.3,"Had a 2014 Ford focus se hatchback with DCT auto transmission. This is a great vehicle other than the transmission. Transmission would at slow speeds hesitate, shudder, jerk back and forth, go in and out of gear, and had metal sounds ( like silverware clanging) coming from under car. When I would take off from a stop you never knew if you were going to go or shake and shudder for 2 to 4 seconds sometimes more and then go. Sometimes it felt it would stall but never did. When I bought this car it did none of this at first and it started to do this after 5 to 7 thousand miles and progressively got worse. Had it in shop at Ford to fix and it was much worse after reprogram. Talked to Ford about it again and was told that the shuddering could never be totally fixed and would always be there due to nature of transmission. I told them I had looked on the internet and saw that this was a common problem and that it doesn't seemed to be able to be fixed by Ford and that I wasn't happy about this. At this point they tried to get me into another Ford vehicle but did not give me a good trade in value for my 1 year old vehicle (I wonder why???). It was the one chance the Ford dealer had at keeping me and they screwed up so I traded my vehicle in somewhere else. All the money I've spent on service visits repairs and new tires (4 sets) over the years on other fords I guess didn't mean much. I am now giving my business to a company that has very good reliability ratings for their vehicles so hopefully I don't run into this again.

AVOID FORD","After 73 yrs I thought I would treat myself to my first new car ever. Bearing in mind we were a ford family since 1947 and I drove a 2004 mercury marquis for 11 yrs it was reasonable to think buying a new ford from wayne akers ford in lake worth florida was the right thing. I bought a new focus and after 10 days and the trans locking up 4 times in 400 miles I returned to the dealership to uplift this deal. They pleaded with me to take another new 2014 ford focus same model same deal same price after 4-5 hours of fighting with them they convinced me to take another . I went along with their offer ..... But when I was presented with a bill for around 2400.00 I insisted they call me a cab . As I refused either to take mycar back and or accept their offer of ""Even exchange"" with a diff of 2400. They reduced it to 1200....No thank you then 600 . After 6 hours of fighting I agreed to 400. The next morning I woke up and checked the ""Very same car"" not to be so they substituted a much cheaper model over a 1000.00 cheaper I drove to the dealership and they refused to acknowledge this.. (oops I am a retired mechanic had my own shop) so off to small claims court their attorney claimed they made a mistake and pleaded with me to accept 1500.00 so they did not want to go in front of the judge. I lost 325.00 on the filing fees. The new focus was better the transmission did not lock up but jerked hesitated late and early changes car jerked violently when I went to the dealer a good few times their standard response ""We could not duplicate problem"" eventually the loud banging the dealer could not deny they replaced the trans. As for the very very poor gas mileage 16-18 mpg they told me they checked and I was getting 29.5 mpg I decided to make a pictural history everytime I filled up 3/4 tank 1/2 ank 1/4 tank and the comp proved that I was getting barely 17/19 at best I advised the dealer that the violent jerking was affecting my spinal surgery which the neuro surgery determined I was permanently disabled . After 2 yrs of very bad service horrible horrible car . I traded it in for a 2013 ford fusion landed costing me over 21000.00 for a car that should be crushed recalled ford screwed up 2013/4 ford focus and costs americans millions of dollars in fords screw up possibly worse than the ford pinto or the edsel UPDATE AFTER PAYING 400.00 (WHY FOR AN EVEN EXCHANGE ) I RECEIVED A NEW EVEN EXCHANGE ONLY TO WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING TO FIND IT WAS A STRIPPED DOWN MODEL.

They pleaded with me to take another new 2014 ford focus same model same deal same price after 4-5 hours of fighting with them they convinced me to take another . I went along with their offer ..... But when I was presented with a bill for around 2400.00 I insisted they call me a cab . As I refused either to take mycar back and or accept their offer of ""Even exchange"" with a diff of 2400. They reduced it to 1200....No thank you then 600 . After 6 hours of fighting I agreed to 400. The next morning I woke up and checked the ""Very same car"" not to be so they substituted a much cheaper model over a 1000.00 cheaper I drove to the dealership and they refused to acknowledge this.. (oops I am a retired mechanic had my own shop) so off to small claims court their attorney claimed they made a mistake and pleaded with me to accept 1500.00 so they did not want to go in front of the judge. I lost 325.00 on the filing fees. The new focus was better the transmission did not lock up but jerked hesitated late and early changes car jerked violently when I went to the dealer a good few times their standard response ""We could not duplicate problem"" eventually the loud banging the dealer could not deny they replaced the trans. As for the very very poor gas mileage 16-18 mpg they told me they checked and I was getting 29.5 mpg I decided to make a pictural history everytime I filled up 3/4 tank 1/2 ank 1/4 tank and the comp proved that I was getting barely 17/19 at best I advised the dealer that the violent jerking was affecting my spinal surgery which the neuro surgery determined I was permanently disabled . After 2 yrs of very bad service horrible horrible car . I traded it in for a 2013 ford fusion landed costing me over 21000.00 for a car that should be crushed recalled ford screwed up 2013/4 ford focus and costs americans millions of dollars in fords screw up possibly worse than the ford pinto or the edsel UPDATE AFTER PAYING 400.00 (WHY FOR AN EVEN EXCHANGE ) I RECEIVED A NEW EVEN EXCHANGE ONLY TO WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING TO FIND IT WAS A STRIPPED DOWN MODEL. I RETURNED TO WAYNE AKERS WHO DENIED THEY HAD GIVEN ME A CHEAPER MODEL RESULTING IN ME TAKING THEM TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE I WON MY CASE THEY EVENTUALLY REFUNDED ME 1500 I LOST THE 400.00 AND THE FILING FEES THIS NEW FORD FOCUS REQUIRED A NEW TRANSMISSION AFTER A FEW THOUSAND MILES THE GAS MILEAGE WAS AROUND 15/6 MPG I ASKED THE WAYNE AKERS SERVICE DEPT ABOUT THIS DESCREPENCY RE GAS MILEAGE AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE EPA THAT STATED THE GAS MILEAGE TO BE 20/24 NOT FORD . AFTER MY FOURTH VISIT TO THE SERVICE DEPT I WAS DESPERATE TO GET RID OF THIS PIECE OF JUNK I TRADED IT IN ON A USED ""FORD CERTIFIED"" FORD FUSION WITH 28,000 MILES THAT SHOWED FORD HAD INSTALLED A NEW ENGINE AT 5000 MILES I LOST A FURTHER BUNCH OF MONEY AND PAID ANOTHER 5000 .00 (I BELIEVE ) TO BUY AN OLDER CAR THE LOSSES WERE MOUNTING REAL FAST NOW AFTER 8000 MILES ON THE FORD FUSION THE TRANSMISSION KICKS DOWN HARD I TOOK IT BACK IN MARCH 2020 AND WAYNE AKERS REFUSED TO TOOK A LOOK TELLING ME THAT THEIR WORKSHOPS WERE SO SNOWED DOWN WITH TRANSMISSION WORK ""COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AS A RETIRED MOTOR MECHANIC I AM AMAZED AT THE SUBSTANDARD VEHICLES FORD MOTOR CORP IS PUTTING OUT SHAME ON THEM","{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.9964}",-0.9964,1

The top complaints seemed to be about lack of power, poor gas mileage, and suggestion's the car might be better suited for in town driving only. My experience is these reports are totally unfounded. After my first 1,000 miles of driving I never sensed a lack of power in the car under?normal driving conditions. The engine and transmission are super smooth even at highway speeds of up to 75mph. No shaking. No vibration. No increase in engine noise. Steering has an excellent feel to it. Inside the cabin, I have read reviews comparing this car to a tall Fiesta. I owned a Fiesta and the Ecosport seems much more roomy inside with plenty of room for my knees on either side. Fuel economy averaged 32.5 in mostly in town driving. This was accomplished by keeping a light foot on the pedal. This car also has a gas saving engine turn off feature that works so seamlessly I hardly notice it is working. I have driven several cars where there was a shuddering once you start moving after a traffic light. This was not the case with the Ecosport. Storage area is another plus. It allows the rear passenger seats to fold completely flat. The one area I was sorely disappointed in was the performance of the premium 10 speaker B&O system. It sounded tinny, and congested and was vastly inferior to the standard system on my Hyundai Elantra. Checking the replacement cost for the individual speakers, I found they averaged about $20 each. In other words, junk. So in order to remedy the poor sound I went to a local auto stereo store and was told that in order to upgrade the amplifier I needed a $500 device in addition to the replacement amp in order to translate the digital signals from the head unit to the new amplifier. This basically makes upgrading the amp non cost effective. The good news is the existing amp can be used to power premium replacement speakers. My choice was the Focal Expert Flax 2 way components for the front. This represented a significant upgrade to the sound of the system. The morale of the story is that if you are considering buying the Titanium for the premium system I would recommend you save your money and get the SE which will allow you to replace the amp and speakers without issue.",This is a great little version of an SUV it's a smaller version it's perfect for somebody who doesn't want the big gas guzzlersit's just perfect for young family or someone who just wants a small version of an SUV the only thing that I would see negative is it just needs a little more leg room in the back but who's driving it just for themselves it's perfectI love my Ford escape but I?wanted to downsize and this was the perfect version for downsizing to I'm very very happy with it,"Honestly National reviews and some user reviews are way off, read some international reviews I feel they are far more objective and not so biased.

Love SYNC 3 and 8 inch touchscreen this interface is the best in the business far superior to Honda, sound system with 7 speakers sound fantastic easy to use system honestly. Love the ambient lighting and moon roof, the bliss system is useful, backup camera is very good as well. Very little body roll in turns, since it is based on Fiesta Chassis this car is fun to drive handling is good. The 1.0 contrary to the whiners is the same in performance to the Honda HRV. Passing power is more than adequate, it's no speed demon but this is not some drag racing car. MPG I get over 30 on highway easily. To placate the whiners Ford should have included the higher tuned version which outputs 140 hp but other reviews far exaggerate the lack of power and I have owned a SS Camaro and I can live fine with this daily commuter.

99,ford C-MAX,4.9,"First off there are no tax credits available, because it is not a plug in...check out the CMAX Energi....but the first tank of gas lasted to almost 600 miles and accumulated MPGs =41. It is far easier to park with the standard backup camera, and space inside is comfortable in both front & back seat. Cargo space is enough for my traveling gym equipment, musical instruments, & a few filled grocery bags & the retractable cover is handy to conceal contents. Handling the vehicle in driving indicates a quick response to sudden steering changes with stability of holding, reasonable acceleration for merging or lane change or sudden evasive moves to avoid another vehicle. I like the interior lighting around the key entrance, and the turn signal lights on the rearview mirrors gives extra visibility to traffic.","I was pleasantly surprised after driving this car how it impressed me. I read the so called critics reviews on how the Prius was the most popular hybrid, but I decided to review this C Max myself. I am slightly over 6 Ft and immediately noticed the huge headroom of the C max that dwarfs the other hybrids. The C max is quiet, smooth ride, comfortable, very roomy and incredible view including a much higher seating position. The REALLY exciting feature is the performance. As everyone knows, the Toyota Prius might get better mileage but at the cost of super slow acceleration. Trying to merge on a freeway with a Prius is downright dangerous! However, I took the C max out and trust me when I say this hybrid is night and day faster. It's actually 4 seconds faster from 0-60 than a Prius and actually faster than any other hybrids in its class. I was sold on the other features already ,but the car like handling and performance really sealed the deal. I just bought the Titanium model with the larger 17 inch wheels. If you are shopping for a Prius, please test the C max like I did. No Prius for this guy!","To give a little perspective, I'm 5'7"", 155 lbs. and coming from a 2010 Toyota Matrix. I've had Toyotas for years mainly because of their superb reliability. I've had 3 Fords in the past and swore I'd never get another one, again, mainly because of their reliability or, more precisely, their lack thereof. However, Toyota no longer makes a Matrix and its CH-R has horrible visibility and acceleration - two qualities very important to me. The Ford C-Max, by contrast, has both excellent visibility and very good acceleration - 8.1 seconds 0-60 mph according to Edmunds. I was leery about buying another Ford because of my concern with reliability, but given some of the other qualities I was looking for in a car I decided to take a chance on the C-Max. For example, it has very good gas mileage. I bought it on 8-17-17. Back then I was getting 52 mpg driving locally (far superior to the EPA estimate of 42) and 38 mpg on the highway. I live in MA and in the cold, e.g. 10-30 degrees F, the mpg has dipped considerably to about 35 locally and 33-36 on the highway depending on how fast you go. On a trip up the Maine turnpike at Christmas I got 34 mpg going 75 mph; on the way back and going 65 mph I got 37 mpg. Basically, when it was warm I was getting over 700 miles per tankful (13.5 gal. tank) with mostly local driving and now that winter has arrived I'm getting about 460 miles per tankful with mostly local driving. As you can see cold weather and high speeds really knock the mpg down. Another quality is its visibility in both front and back unlike several of the Japanese designed cars. As mentioned above, its acceleration is very good as well. With the Matrix I was fearful every time I had to merge onto a highway with oncoming traffic or get through an intersection with oncoming traffic. Those fears have been allayed with the C-Max. Also, the seats are very comfortable. It has adjustable lumbar support for the driver and the seats sit higher than my Matrix did for a better view of the road, but not as high as an SUV. It is by far the most quiet car I've ever owned and it feels very smooth. Steering is responsive. The brakes are fine. Headroom is terrific for anyone over 6 feet tall. In the snow it's fine. Granted, this car does not have awd, but for a fwd vehicle it's fine. I'm sure the weight of the car helps too. It's very heavy. One can feel it just in the weight of the doors. It weighs 3640 lbs versus 2830 for my Matrix. I'm approaching the 6000 mile mark and have had no problems thus far (knock on wood). Long term reliability remains to be seen, but so far so good. As far as negatives go, I wish the ground clearance was higher. I believe it's about 5.5 inches comparable to a VW Golf, Honda Civic, or Subaru Impreza which means I need to be very careful when going over speed bumps. I also wish it had a spare tire. The battery is located where the wheel well is located for most cars leaving no room for a spare. That means that whenever I travel up north, e.g. through the White and Green Mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont respectively, I have to pray I don't get a flat because the chances of driving into a dead cell are good, thereby making it impossible to call roadside assistance or AAA to get towed. If the lack of spare doesn't bother you, I highly recommend the car. As far as price goes, the sticker price on my SE model with the cold weather package was about 25.5K. I got it for 20K. And the Ford dealer gave me what I wanted for my Matrix in trade - Kelly Blue Book value for a car in very good condition. Why Ford doesn't advertise this car is beyond me. So far it's been a real pleasure to drive. (Update: 6/28/18) I'm currently at the 11,500 mile mark and I recently had a flat. I hit a curb and the rear passenger tire blew. Luckily I was in town and able to make it home to my driveway. It was on a Saturday at 5 p.m.; therefore, all the service stations were closed. I called the Ford roadside assistance number and set up an appointment to get towed to a Ford dealer (Acton Ford) two miles away on the following Monday. Thank God I wasn't in the boondocks somewhere. Because the belt was broken they had to replace the whole tire. So, feeling that I dodged a bullet, I asked the owner's son of Acton Ford if it was possible to get a full size spare. Doughnuts are only good for about 40-50 miles. He was able to find me an after market rim from tirerack.com and was able to mount a cheap Kelly tire onto the rim. It fits behind the rear seats. I went to Walmart and bought a folding lug wrench and a jack. There's a small compartment next to the battery where they fit perfectly. At least now I have peace of mind. I also renewed my membership with AAA. Ford roadside assistance provides towing for only up to 30 miles and when you call they want you to have a smart phone so they can send you a text to arrange service. At least with AAA you can talk with a live person.","First off there are no tax credits available, because it is not a plug in...check out the CMAX Energi....but the first tank of gas lasted to almost 600 miles and accumulated MPGs =41.

112,ford Fusion,4.5,"Before this car I had a 2012 fusion, and all anyone wanted to do is set stuff on the deck lid and place their biscuits on the hood while waiting for me. Thankyou Ford for making that slightly less achievable. I like the new fuel door, definitely a better design than the 2012 model that had a capless system, but the fuel door would never seal at all. The headlights look easier to replace or work on. The engine compartment looks like it has a fair amount of space to work in if you plan on keeping it long enough. It looks like the computer is in the engine bay which seems a bit cringe, but it looks far enough away from the engine that it couldn't hurt. The battery is partially under the rain gutter, but it looks easy enough to slide out and replace when it comes down to it. The suspension is great as always. This car also stops on a dime which is great. The trunk compartment is cavernous; it looks like you could fit 2-4 people back there.

Is not Ford is the nature how GDI engines works, im saying all this for let you know this engines need basic maintenance in time, dont blame later on the car or manufacture. My car runs very well, come with a lot of mid/high end features, The reason why i dont give to it 5 starts is the MPG is not that good being a 1.5 Liters it gives me 23MPG in city witch is the same as a V6 engine. Also the tail is not very stable in raining days, it slides easy. Overall I like more than other mid size sedans in the market. My car is 2020 I will need more time for give a review over time and reliability. So far I like it, works fine. ","Before this car I had a 2012 fusion, and all anyone wanted to do is set stuff on the deck lid and place their biscuits on the hood while waiting for me. Thankyou Ford for making that slightly less achievable. I like the new fuel door, definitely a better design than the 2012 model that had a capless system, but the fuel door would never seal at all. The headlights look easier to replace or work on. The engine compartment looks like it has a fair amount of space to work in if you plan on keeping it long enough. It looks like the computer is in the engine bay which seems a bit cringe, but it looks far enough away from the engine that it couldn't hurt. The battery is partially under the rain gutter, but it looks easy enough to slide out and replace when it comes down to it. The suspension is great as always. This car also stops on a dime which is great. The trunk compartment is cavernous; it looks like you could fit 2-4 people back there.

The inside was also more comfortable although I did buy the lariat trim. The only negative is that so far the city mileage is about 18mpg. My first highway trip was 28 mpg, however so that was cool.

Used it to move furniture day after getting it. Fits lots! Plenty of space for tools behind front seats. Great acceleration, smooth on hwy. Looks, drives, and carries better than Tacomas, for way less money. Good deal from Encinitas Ford. Very happy.","I got the truck to replace my 2019 ford connect do i was pretty familiar with the interior and controls. I got an STX/FX4 package and it looks mean and handles really well. I took the truck to the coast (Eureka CA) right out the gates and let me tell you coming from a connect van with a 4 cyl and no power this thing was a big difference up the hills. When i purchased it i actually did not realize it had a turbo i was just thinking of gas mileage efficiency. It had no problem getting up the steep hills with a moderate load like 500 pounds of tools and 2 passangers and it handled the curves like it was on tracks. So far in 6 days i have put 1500 miles on it and have been babying the engine. Im getting 21 mpg average which is not too bad with a 4x4 truck. Overall i like the driveability but do wish they offered the navigation as an option on the lower trim but it looks like a cool 2500 bucks can get you a sync 3 with a replacement dash panel so may go that route. Besides that it still has a back up cam and pre collision alert and you can lock/unlock/ remote start with the ford pass app still so thats pretty great. Update December 2021 still love the truck I've had it since July and put 25k miles on it and no issues so far. The 4x4 system has held up on a couple weeks of rough 12 hour days on cell tower mountain roads, dusty and rough terrain with a bunch of washboard cut areas. It handled pretty good even got some air time trying to keep up with a decked out f350. I do want to add a 20 inch Led bar in the huge hole that is in the front bumper or at least a mesh. The interior has held up so far it is not a high trim level so vinyl floors clean up easy. Still getting 21 mpg average with a steel camper shell added 200 lbs and 500 lbs of tools. It does fairly good up hills/steep grade roads and easily switches to manual gear selection for easy downhill control. Oil changes are pretty easy DIY, a few oil change places have turned down working on the truck because they don't want to deal with removing the bash plate but it is just 4 bolts (way less than many plastic undercarriage covers for cars) also the tiny engine takes 6.25 quarts of oil so it gets pricy.

I am a huge stickler when it comes to a feeling of quality, and this little car does just that. The interior is trimmed out very nicely for a subcompact. Nothing feels cheap, although the center console is a little flimsy. Even the hard plastics feel nice to the touch, and soft touch materials are abundant throughout the cabin. Controls are basic, but nice. The center display screen is a very nice touch and simple to use with the rotary dial. The car is incredibly fun to drive! Idk what the whole gripe about it being slow is!? The car makes 106 hp and weighs just over 2400 lbs. it literally feels like you are driving for a Miata sedan! ItÂfs very zippy, and the handling is phenomenal. The sound system is excellent and IÂfd have to put it on par with my 03 Lexus. Fuel mileage is astronomical while averaging 43 mpg everywhere I seem to go. The manual transmission is something I would recommend as well. My only gripe would be as I am a taller guy, it takes a while to find a comfortable position. Other than that I could not be happier with this car! It is a blast to drive","Fantastic gas mileage, stylish looks, fun to drive. Loads of standard features. I drive mostly in town and under 40 mph. It is a perfect car for metro driving.

""According to Toyota, using their word, ALL 2019 windshield will have distortion on the bottom few inches, and it is normal, even if it may distract the driver!"" and here's the long version; When you test drive the 2019 Yaris, check the lower section, especially toward the corner of the windshield. My mother bought brand new 2019 Yaris, and on her way home, she noticed that windshield is distorted and distrust her driving. I understand she should have noticed the issue when she test drive it, but test drive around the dealership and one exit on highway wasn't enough for her to find it out.... We went back to the Toyota dealership, and their sales guys, service technicians all agreed it is a defect. two days later, we received a call from the dealership and was told it is not a defect; The area service rep from Toyota came and looked at it, and said it is normal since there's another Yaris with the same issue. Two defected cars won't make it normal, but apparently it does for Toyota!! We called Toyota to see if there's any resolution for it, and was told by corporate customer support that it is ""Characteristic"" of 2019 Yaris. I told if windshield distort image it is a defect, and she said it is an opinion and Toyota sees it as a characteristic. And ALL 2019 Yaris would be the same with distorted windshield!

The little quirks: 1) You don't realize how much you use an external trunk release until you have a car that doesn't have one. Seriously, what were they thinking? Storage is at a premium, so you'll be fishing out your fob to go into the trunk A LOT. Using the interior release isn't a solution as the vacuum created in the car when you close your door will pull the trunk closed and latched when you exit. Literally... every... single... time you exit. 2) That horn... OMG, the horn on my Nissan Juke was more aggressive. And, due to its location, swapping it out is quite an ordeal. I literally do not use the horn, ever, even for a short tap to jar someone from their phone screen. It's embarrassing. 3) The wind buffeting/thrumming when the windows are down is awful. I don't know how Toyota missed this. It is correctible for about $100 with a couple of unobtrusive wind deflectors which can be mounted on the body of the sideview mirrors' housings. Makes a huge difference and they really aren't noticeable at all. This issue is so severe I expect Toyota will eventually make modifications to the sideview housing bodies to self-correct this issue. 4) Side view mirror tilt extreme. When reversing, the passenger side view tilts down at around 70%. It is literally at so drastic an angle you have a great view of the curb but can barely see another car when parallel parking. With BIMMERCODE you can recode the car to tip the mirror to a more reasonable angle (I used 40%). Again, while it has some annoying quirks, overall it is a fantastic car.","Moving from an A90 Launch Edition to an A91 Limited wasnÂft as fulfilling as I had anticipated. While the Âe21 A91 is 40+ horsepower more than the Âe20, itÂfs best attribute is a bit more stability at speed. While the car needs to be lower still, the suspension tweaks have taken some of the play out of the vehicle. There are downsides however. The A90 was incredibly tunable, to date the?A91 ECU is locked. The A90 Launch had a HUD, but not the comparably priced A91 does not. The carbon fiber spoiler that was shown as part of the A91 promo photos was cut due to supplier issues. With that said the refraction blue is beautiful and the lines of the Supra are strong & the car has an undeniable presence. So ultimately IÂfm still pleased to be a Supra owner.","I saw it and bought it without even driving it. Loved the look especially in silver. Was going to buy new Corvette but not with price insanity. Got a fully loaded 3.0 premium 2021 for 57 k. First thing you notice is how crazy fast this car is and I drive a Mustang Boss 302 which this car will blow away. Very under rated horsepower at 382. Probably over 410 and what a great transmission. Shifting in sport mode is very well programmed and is better than manual unless you are really stuck on shifting. Nothing in this car is even close to finding fault with except the stupid horn which sounds like Peewee Hermans bike horn. Interior is very nice and comfortable. I am 5-9 but will seat taller although getting in requires some flexibility. You will love how it handles on the turns, how the differential gives traction, and the speed so fun. Take a test ride and see what you are missing. Car is also a head turner. The day I drove it home was some pleasant surprise. I picked up my 2021 GR Supra 3.0 Premium in September of 2020. Five months later, I've had time to explore all it's little quirks and conclude I'm enormously satisfied. First, power is not lacking in this car.

131,toyota Camry,4.9,I live this car. It is comfortable to ride in - both front seats and back. There is very little road noise. Although I have the smaller engine it has plenty HP for what I need from a daily driver. Pano moon roof is a nice feature. The JBL stereo system is nice. As of now I have no complaints at all.,"I upgraded to a 2022 SE from 2019 SE. While the cars are basically the same. I appreciate some of the standard things you get in the 22 (heated mirrors with integrated turn signals, dual climate control, transmission drive modes, lane tracing assist). Toyota definitely get the transmission tuning right in the 22. The car drives smoother and feels more buttoned down. The 19 while overall?is great car ( no problems at all) but it didn't have a smoothest transmission at times when moving at lower speeds. So far very satisfied with the 22.","Great vehicle. I donÂft have a ÂgheavyÂh foot so donÂft need a race car. I was mainly looking for a vehicle with a smooth/quiet ride, excellent gas mileage, and a reputation for longevity. This car delivers on all of those. IÂfm really impressed by the technology and advanced safety features as well. Looking forward to years of reliability.","I live this car.
