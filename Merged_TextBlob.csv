2002 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),"It's been a great delivery vehicle for my cafe business good power, economy match easily taken care of. Havent repaired anything or replaced anything but tires and normal maintenance items. Upgraded tires to Michelin LX series helped fuel economy. Would buy another in a second",3.0
2002 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 3500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),"Bought this car as a commuter vehicle for a van pool. I was very disappointed in the vehicle in comparison to a 1997 model I had previously. The motor was sluggish and tended to have a rough idle. The A/C was better than the old van, but still lacked a separate control for the front and back. What I was most disappointed with was that in moving up five years, I lost driver room, the ability to adjust the steering wheel to where I like it, and the passenger seats, by all accounts were less comfortable. What I noticed in driving is that the vehicle had a very large turning radius. Very difficult to maneuver in traffic.",2.0

2001 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),"Good solid frame and suspension. Well equipped, full power. Gauges and controls are well designed and located. Nice to drive once you are up and in. No leg room on passenger side. 318 engine seems very weak and some spark plugs are very hard to access. Terrible gas mileage (avg 12MPG). Sheet metal is flimsy and dents if you lean against it or bump it. Paint chips and scratches very easily. Sliding side door jumped the track and scraped the whole side of the van. Rear door caught in wind and pulled bolts out of frame. Three front windshields in three years (stress point in center?). No mechanical problems with drive train. Reliable. Still not the quality my older Dodge vans had.",3.0

2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 2500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),"Purchased the vehicle in 2003 second hand with 15000 miles from the owner (a one driver operator, not rental). This review was written in 2017 with only 110000 miles on it! It has been a great service van for my business but not without flaws. After warranty expired problems begin. Had to replace computer controller few times. Fuel hose went bad, chair adjustment lever broke, minor repairs here and there, water pump replaced, temperature control unit replaced, gas tank and pump replaced. Using a very accurate repair expenses controlled by business analysis I can say that the average repair cost is around $600 per year. This vehicle can't go farther than 10 trips without me worrying when would be the next problem. Dealer sticker say 12/15 miles per gallon but with very conservative driving my records show 17 miles per gallon. Overall I don't think it's the best value for vehicle but being optimistic as I am it is not the worst either. Hope this helps.",3.0
2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Ext Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),"Bought used with 34k,the conversion package by Elk automotive is top rate. Has leather, cd, dvd, rear air, tv, rear stereo, all the goodies. Very easy to drive despite its size, ride is nice and quiet inside. With the 318 engines and regular service these things are allmost bullet-proof. As most manufacturers produce very few of the large van conversions any more and the new ones costing 50k that are available, I feel that for 20k I stole this thing. One of the best things is it's still under warranty with Chryslers 7/70 plan. These are the only way to travel, if you are buying for everyday use, it's probably not the right vehicle.",3.0

2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),"I am a mechanic, I bought my 2006 Dodge Magnum 3.5 High Output AWD a year ago with 54,600 miles on it. As always, I performed a full vehicle check on the car before purchasing it. I loved this car, it was fast fun, elegant, and provided everything I needed, at first. Since I bought it I have had numerous mechanical, programing, and electrical issues currently totaling to $4,500 dollars. Just to give an idea, at 70,000 miles my throttle just went out (this isn't included in what I have already spent) and I now have to replace the entire intake system which is going to cost around $2,200 (these costs don't include mechanics fees, which will potentially double the costs) *A battery cost $300",3.0

2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I drove a Dodge Charger last year and like the ride, so when it was time for a new car I went for the Magnum. I like to be able to load stuff the flea market and go fishing so I went with the wagon. It was like driving a SUV, and the speed!!! I had to check myself a few times, but this is the most powerful car I ever had. I drove a Nissan Altima for 2 years and this is a whole new class of car. Stylish, fast, a real head turner. It had over 80,000 miles, but you can't tell by the way it rides and excels on the road. So far so good, it seem to be a well build wagon with AWD for the snow, glad that I got this....",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I had many problems with my Magnum RT. Wheels started to corrode, transmission leaked, windshield wiper controls had to be replaced (all fixed under warranty). Had to replace factory tires at 31,000 miles, replaced a tie-rod at about 40,000 miles, and the brake rotors warped. Wiper controls were again acting up, and a noise started in the front suspension when I finally decided to trade it off. Loved the power and looks, but it had to go. Build and component quality was awful. This car turned me off of Dodge products.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"What an unbelievable machine. I have never driven anything like it. Perfectly engineered, meticulously designed. Simply perfect. It's time for Toyota to stop relentlessly pursuing perfection. Because Dodge got there first with the magnum rt. The power is unbelievable. Handling outstanding. And comfort is second to none. I've been a mustang owner and lover for the past 15 years. But now, after driving this magnum hemi for less than a week, I'm in love with it. With 82k miles it feels as if it just rolled off the assembly line and into my garage. Simply amazing automobile.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Man, this thing is huge - at 4500 lbs it weighs as much my wife's mininvan! And, it drives like it, too - not exactly ""agile."" I would have never payed $35,000 for a new one, but for $13,000 w/65,000 miles I think it was a steal, and it's one of the coolest looking cars ever. Doesn't feel as fast as you might think it would, and gas mileage still not good even w/cylinder management. But, every time I look at it or smash the gas, it makes me smile. Oh, and it'll hold quite a bit of crap, too.",2.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"I am very happy with my magnum. I was looking a car with a lot of room. My magnum is a car with the space of a SUV. It has the small V6 so the gas mileage is not all that bad. I would of never got a SUV with 51,000 miles for the great price I paid for my car. My 2006 Magnum is like new.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"Love the style. Mine has color matched 22"" chrome wheels...had a side wall puncture. Can't replace just one tire and had to go to several places to find a good tire in stock since I did not want to wait to order tires. Cost for 2 was pricey but that has nothing to do with the car. Also, to anyone thinking about beefing up the look with big tires and rims, okay for around town but you lose some of the quality in the ride. Have tried to figure out why but no one can give me an answer. Non the less, with the color coordinated rims (car is metallic red) it's an eye catcher. No mechanical problems. It's a 2006 SE 2.7 with 40,000. I wasn't looking to win a race and don't want a gas hog.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Traved to Michigan from PA to by this car used with 28,000 on it.Downsized from a 01 AWD Towne and Country Limited.This car is fast without a doubt and functional to boot. I have hauled my 20' extension ladder and wheelbarrow in the back with the seats folded down. More than enough room for the dog. Had to replace both outer tie rods(under warranty) and o2 sensor (warranty ran out) but still happy with the vehicle. Will add roof rack.Great in the snow with snow tires as I have owned 4 wheel drive and AWD before.Got to have it here in this area. Have to wait and see how it holds up but so far so good.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"This is a very large car that handles like a sports car. Corners flat, breaks straight, very comfortable ride and considering the too small engine, it has good acceleration. It does NOT like to pull a trailer, but if you're reasonable it's okay with that too. The drivers seat is far too narrow, I'm a big guy and have to find just the right spot to get comfortable. Some people don't like the sparten interior, but I like the design. However, a little less of a plastic look would be nice. The exterior design is outstanding and there are lots of storage pockets and nooks and crannies. The standard tires are just adequate, but in Canada you really do need snow tires for winter safety.",3.0

2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I traded in my 3rd Yukon Denali 3 years ago for this car and I love it. I didn't need a big SUV, but I still needed the use of a utility vehicle for my business, kids and dogs. This car is great. I average 20mpg with the 5.7 Hemi. I can have my cake and eat it too. I leased the car back in 2006 and just thought I would lease or buy another car when my time was up, but Chrysler sent me an offer I couldn't refuse. If I buy the car at the end of the lease, Chrysler will take a substantial amount off the residual buyout amount in the contract, so Iv'e decided to buy the car. 3 years and 57K miles later I haven't had any problems except with the navi which is a minor repair hopefully.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I needed to replace my aging and worn out Volvo 850 wagon. We are a family of 5 including two teenagers, one who is 6 feet tall. I needed a roomy car, that actually had legroom in the rear seat for my son. Short of buying a limo the Dodge LX cars are one of the only ones that fit the bill. I also wanted power and safety in the way of front and side air bags, trac control etc, etc. This car has it all in spades. I set out to but the 6cyl SXT but couldn't pass up the R/T when it crossed my tracks. If you are sensible on the throttle the R/T's fuel mileage is almost as good as the 3.5 SXT. My advice is if you have a choice, buy the R/T with the 5.7, it's way more fun and still decent on fuel.",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),"I bought my '06 SXT RWD used in Nov. '06 with 13k miles. It now has nearly 81k miles. Overall, it's been very reliable...roomy, comfortable, fast, no rattles, and decent gas mileage (22 mpg avg. in mixed highway and city gridlock). The RWD has only been a problem once, in a very heavy snow. The front brake rotors were replaced at 38k, and will need to be replaced again soon. The original tires lasted to 71k. At approx. 75k, a rocker arm broke, a $500 fix. The mechanic says it's common, but not frequent, on the 3.5 liter motor. Other than that, just oil changes and tire rotation. I love the styling of the car, too bad it's been discontinued. Everyone who rides in it loves it!",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),We bought the base Magnum back in July 05 when my wife totaled her PT Cruiser. This car is a great driving car and we get 24MPG overall with the 2.7 liter engine. Mileage is very comparable to the many small SUVs we were looking at before we decided to buy our Magnum. The 2.7L engine is lively and responsive and we've experienced no problems mechanically.,3.0

2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"The SE is fun to drive, has wonderful racy styling and handles like a dream. It corners flat and holds the road beautifully. The 2.7 Liter engine is a little underpowered for the size of the vehicle, but considering it is such a small engine, I have no problem with available power. I purchased the 2.7 specifically because I wanted a vehicle that affords good fuel economy, and it delivers that plus I like driving the Magnum. I purchased the car in 2008 and am very happy with the value received. I get a car that looks and feels like a new car and the 2 years depreciation (60% off new price) give me a real bargain. I don't understand it but like getting such a great bargain!",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I went from a 2006 Honda Odyssey (3 steering racks in 20,000 miles was 3 too many) to the RT. The cargo volume is not quite that of the van but it is good. Four guys and golf bags are handled with ease. The gas mileage to date (5500 miles) is one mile to the gallon worse than the Honda. The fun to drive factor is approximately 8.5 out of 10. If you have to drive a wagon this is the one that will make you smile. I can only imagine how much fun the SRT8 must be to drive. I am already planning some tweaks to the engine and suspension because the chassis is just so good that it begs for more power and better spring rates. This really is a great platform, hats off to the engineers at Dodge",3.0
2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),"I bought my 06' to replace my aging Durango and from day one it was a great choice. Even though I did not get the AWD, it still rocks in any weather, with the addition of Blizzaks for the winter. I'm 6'4"" and it is really comfortable, plus with two car seats in the back, the kids have enough room too. I put the whole family in and we go looking fo twisty turny roads to play on. With the autostick, I can run that car pretty hard and it just keeps asking for more. Cruises really nicely for the 25 mile each way commute, but gotta keep an eye on it. I tend to enjoy driving and sometimes look down and see 80 when I'm just having fun. Definitely a family car for dad to have fun in!",3.0

I was statisfied with the price, leather , styling, sunroof, and the space. Hope it would be as powerful as my 1970 Cutlass which I missed dearly, and holy cow it was. Not only was it peppy and powerful but I had all the safety and comfort of a car built today. And yes, it does get good gas mileage when driven nicely, which I personally cannot do!

It could have been an instant muscle car but the 3.5 L V6 just didn't have it.I mean the 3.5 is a great motor just not the Horse power I wanted. So I bought a 2006 SRT8 w/ the 6.1 L Hemi. Wow! It's balck just like the one before and a whole lot faster. The power is almost unbelivable between the two. I miss the all leather seats and moon roof the SXT had.

It is very useful as you can carry other people or use it to go to the hardware store. It is fast and fun to drive on top of that. It handles very good and rides really nice on the highway. I had the RT before my SRT8 and both of these cars are real nice. It reminds me of my younger days in the 60's when a lot of people had ""sleeper wagons."" It runs with most cars on the street and yet gets great gas mileage. 425 HP and I am averaging between 19 and 21 MPG. Depends on how many times you put your foot into it. How can you beat that?

It does not have alot of power but I do get 20 mpg in the city. I have not taken it on any long trips so I don't know the highway mpg.

I have owned 24 cars from classic Impalas, Corvettes, Camaros and list goes on. I actually traded a 1996 Impala SS for the SRT-8. There is nothing bad at all to say about this car.

2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"This is a company car for us. The 2.7 liter engine provides merely adequate performance from a stop and at speed, and I'd recommend one of the larger engines. The legroom is excellent for front and back passengers. The headroom is very good. The telescoping steering wheel is extremely helpful and complements the power driver's seat to find an ideal driving position relative to the fixed position pedals. The ride is excellent. Cornering feels solid and not as though it's a 4000 pound vehicle. Rear cargo space is limited, unless folding the rear seats.

When I finally decided to buy it, I never regretted my decision. This car handles like a sports car with the Mercedes suspension. The car is bearly broken in so the only issue I have is with the city mileage. The first tank was all local driving (NYC) and I got 12 mpg. I have to be careful getting on the highway because you are up to 85 mph before you know it. Great stereo and plenty of room. People are impressed with this one.",3.0

I was worried about the small V6 in such a large car but the pep was sufficient for excellent highway driving. The car is smooth and the steering is sharp for such a large car. Although the small windows in the rear reduce visibility, the side mirrors are the first adequate mirrors I've ever seen on a car making the car much more navigatable through city streets. Fuel economy is actually exceeding the mid-size sedan we traded in. The transmission is uncharacteristically smooth from my previous experiences with Dodge.

But, this car needs the 8 cylinder, not the 6. I don't have the navigation, but the satellite radio, electronics group, sun roof and convenience group are great additions. This has more storage room in the back than our mini-van when both of the bench seats are in it. I'm 6'2"" and feel very comfortable in this.

I chose the 3.5L V-6 because 250 HP is a lot of power, no matter how you cut it. The AWD keeps the wheels firmly planted. I corner hard, and this thing hasn't even squealed the tires a bit. So far, I'm averaging 17.5-19.0 mpg, combined, and driving habits give you the predictable results in that area. Style: this car has it in abundance. It rides like a dream, courtsey the chassis and tranny from the Mercedes E- class underneath. Interior is beautiful, elegant, with a touch of attitude.

You can forget about the baby seat in the back driving this. They need to sell a aftermarket kit to unpimp this ride. The traction in the snow was ok, even without chains",2.0

2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),"Bought a new SRT Magnum for my own retirement gift in 2007. Simply loved it but eventually sold it to a friend's son who kept bugging me for it (for 3 years). After that I owned 2 Chargers, 1 R/T, 1 SRT and a Chrysler 300C. I really missed the wagon because of the versatility and nasty looks so when I was able to find the second wagon I grabbed it. Never have had any issues with any of these vehicles but then I take care of all the maintenance/repair myself so no one can mess them up. There is a HUGE difference between the 5.7 and 6.1 Hemi LX cars pretty much in all respects so for me it will always be the SRT. The 6.1 responds very well to small changes (tuning,exhaust,CAI) and kicks real butt when you also loose 150-200 lbs of weight from the car which is not that hard to do. Even with the 12 sec. 1/4 mile performance I get around 23mpg on 75mph trips. Best of both worlds and the darn thing is a wagon to boot! Kudo's to the SRT team. This gang has brought back the old day attitude and swagger we had in the 60's and early 70's. Chrysler leads and the others follow ( after complaining and trash talking about being beaten of course). Some things never change.",3.0

Only thing I can see is when trying to drive down long straight roads the long wheelbase and ten inch tread in the front goes away from straight much easier than smaller tread tires but it corners unbelievable for a 4,300 lb. wagon with a long wheelbase, I'll take the cornering ability anytime.

The car is a natural street ""looker"" and is well liked by ""car people"". The Red Pearl color is perfect and reinforces the design and general performance stance. I think Dodge has a winner here and every day I drive it I like it more. No matter what my mood, it gets better when I fire up the 6.1 Hemi.

My SRT Magnum came with GPS, Sirius Satelite Radio, all leather interior, (Gray on Black-Standard for SRT8) steering wheel remotes, sunroof and digital gauges with white face gauges. The new Hemi 6.1 liter is just as appealing to look at as the rest of the car. I do feel that the exhuast could have been a bit throatier, however you do hear the engine well at 6000 rpms.

Seats are terrific, way better that the stock RT seats. Driving the car is an exercise in right foot restraint. The barritone soundtrack that comes with a quick jab of the throttle is worth the price of admission alone. The thrust that comes with this right foot exercise is very impressive indeed.

I get 21mpg driving around town but I do a lot of interstate driving and i maintain 25-27mpg. Not better than my Bonneville no, but it certainly gets just as good gas mileage as any other car on the road today. I only wish I had a Magnum R/T. I want the dual chrome exhaust with the Hemi!",3.0

2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"This is a great car. Look at them at the Auto Show when they first came out. Trunk space seemed small for two kids with double stroller. Decided kids could stay in wife's Suburban. Has 5.7 Hemi, 340 HP plenty to make this car move. Great car to customize, very unique and seems like a ""Magnum Club"" when driving. Next vehicle will be the same with the 6.1 Hemi. I am 6'4"" and have plenty of room in the drivers seat.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT AWD 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Bought R/T AWD in May 08, Wicked fun to drive! R/T has good pickup in the 3k+ rpm range. Little sluggish off the line. The front suspension concerns me. Has a clunking noise when you run over an abrupt bump (possible tie-rod end ($100) or ball joints($700) I've been told). Front tires seem to be wearing on the outer edges a little prematurely. New Pirelli's=$$ Plan to change tie rod ends with grease fitted ends soon and then rotate tires and realign. Fuel econ is not the best. Around town I've gotten 19 mph. Hope this car stands test of time though? I sold a good Buick Regal GS for this.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"Bought this car used with 97k on the odometer. Wife wasn't sure about it until she drove it and fell in love with it like me. I was really surprised with the ""snap"" it has for a 2.7, it handles beautifully, and it gets pretty good mileage too (28.5 on a 500 mile round trip at 70mph). Only problems so far are alignment (front inner and outer ball joints already, need to do rears) and my wife wishes it had better lumbar support. Other than that we both love the styling and roominess and wish they weren't discontinuing these cars. I am currently trying to talk my wife into another for me to drive!",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),I absolutely love this car. When I was looking for a car to trade-in for I wanted something with style that stood out from the rest. I would have to agree that the car is difficult to keep in alignment but for a heavy car the mileage is great. We have three daughters and always have enough room for car seats and all of their stuff. A must is the Electronic Stability Program - it really works great on icy roads.,3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"I bought the car used, 1 year old, with 19,000 miles. Now the car has 60,000 miles, the few problems are just little annoyances, the battery light comes on most of the time 10 seconds after I start the car and the driver's side door sometime does not open using the remote. The rest is great. Style, engine, comfort, space. I average 24 mpg in the summer, 21 mpg in the winter, on the highway, not bad for a 5000 Pound car. I am very happy with this car. The handling in the snow is good for a rwd.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I just traded my Durango for the Hemi powered Magnum. Frankly the family didn't need all the space in trade for MPG's. I had to have the utility of an SUV just not the size, but I personally wanted some style. The Magnum was the only option. Toss in the Hemi and it was a no-brainer. I love the agility and responsiveness of the Magnum, the wife loves the practicality, and the kids aren't embarrassed to be seen in it. I've only had it a few days, so the verdict is still out on the quality and reliability. Everything else is nothing less than perfection, given all other things being relatively equal. I hope to enjoy it for many years to come.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Over all I love the look and handling of this car. Plenty of room for the grandkids and all their toys, etc. On the highway gets decent gas mileage however, the intown mileage stinks. The price you pay for the HEMI. Main concern is the transmission leaks and the wheel alignments. We've had it to the dealership twice for both issues and were assured that the problem was fixed; 5 months later we have another transmission leak and it already feels like the front end is out of alignment. (We just purchased new tires before the last alignment)Tires are very expensive for this car and they are already showing significant wear without a lot of miles on them.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"I plan on keeping my magnum to it just can't go anymore. I get excellent gas mileage (27 MPG on the highway).

2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"This car was great for the first 38,000 miles, then the trans had to be rebuilt. Then at 40,000 mile the trans locked up and was replaced with a brand new one. Two weeks later the new trans had to be rebuilt! The car kept clunking and jerking, they found the drive shaft was bad so they replaced it. Then a strange noise appeared, sounded like a bad crankshaft, but found it was in the trans, so its being rebuilt again. All this in 4,000 miles. Whats really sad is that Chrysler could care less! I would never buy one of there products again! They know these transmissions are no good but they just keep using them.",2.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Love the styling and LOVE the Hemi. We have a family joke, ""it's time for a Hemi moment"" on the rare instances when traffic has us waiting. Overall, the Magnum RT is a good car. Deceptively fast as it's a heavy car (just watch the traffic fade away in the rear view). Handling is ok. Several small build issues: odometer was 10% off, alignment&tires are difficult to keep true, rotors and gasket on rear hatch have been replaced. Do not drive hard and then pull into a car wash - I'm convinced that the brake rotors wrapped because of this (warranty did cover).",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"Incredibly dumb that Chrysler discontinued this model. Without a doubt, the best looking wagon to come out of Detroit in decades. After three years, no problems to report on my 2005 R/T. Very fast, nice subtle exhaust note, great mileage - I averaged 27 on the highway at 65 mph. Really like how quiet the car is. Would recommend this as a used car or for those getting the last of the 2008s. Hope to pair this wagon up with a new Challenger in time after the initially rush for them slows down.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Quick review. - Fast - Great styling - 25+ highway MPG with the Hemi - Comfortable - Lose the Continentals and get some 255's all around,3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"I really do. I usually switch cars every two years and have had this one for almost three now, and I plan on keeping it! Not only is it beautiful and unique, it is not bad on mileage for how large it is (I average 19- 20 mpg), it is great for a young mom like me, I can use the back trunk area space for changing diapers, and there is tons of room to get in to install the car seat, and store all the things I lug around. The only thing that has happened (knock on wood) is that the power steering hose blew after 4 months of ownership, but the warranty covered it no prob. It really is an awesome and reliable care, I work for Infiniti and prefer my Magnum over their newer vehicles.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"This is the second Dodge I have purchased. I like the style and looks of the Magnum. The one item that I do not like is the self sealing tires. The first few miles you drive, it feels as if the tires are cement slabs.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"This is a family car with attitude. We love the aggressive styling inside and out. I love how the car just glides over the road, even with all the pot holes from this last winter. The only issue we have had so far is the washer sprayers on the hood broke. Those as well as most of the Magnums parts are ""dealer only"". We really didn't want to buy a mini van but that was what we where needing, so glad we found this instead.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I have driven mine for almost 3 years and can report NO PROBLEMS. Lose the Conti tires and put on performance 255 wides and this car comes alive. Now it goes, corners and stops! I would buy a 2008 if I could find one. The RTs must come off a different line than the SXT's because I hardly ever hear of problems. If Chrysler would put in a better dash without all the charcoal gray, it would be an extraordinary car.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT AWD 4dr Wagon (3.5L 6cyl 5A),"I purchased a 2005 SXT AWD, new in June of 2005 (cost $31,500). Here is a list of the issues I've had with it. First, after only 30,000 miles, the factory Continental tires would not pass inspection. Second, after numerous visits to the dealer, about intermittent problems with the rear power windows, the window regulator seized up. Just outside of the warranty. (what a coincidence, and I have the other side to look forward to repairing now) The engine has been running rough for the last 27,000 miles and, of course, the dealer has been unable to diagnose or fix. They just perform the basic ""shotgun"" technique of plugs, wires, etc... I have had the transmission ROM flashed twice and was charged!",2.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE Rwd 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),"After trading in my 1993 SHO for this I am jumping for joy. I have two 6ft 4 son's who fit in the back seat with room to spare. The trunk to the wagon has more then enough space, I call this my truck. Handling a load of one adult size wheelchair and four suit cases. The get up and go with my SXT 3.5 ltr high out put engine is enough for me, think of the ticket's I would have with the R/T. Handles well in all weather, only problem I have is it sit's very low to the road watch out for plastic bag they will get hung up on exhaust and start melting. Over all, I know I will have this wagon for atleast ten more years. And yes I can drive 55 but it does want to use it's power which is there",3.0

I can't believe that Dodge quit making them. I'm trying to find a 2008. Wake up Dodge, no wonder you are having problems. MPG is not bad, I can get 26 MPG if I keep my foot out of it. It has a good carrying capacity and also looks good. They have no other vehicle that can compete on this level. If I can't get a 2008 I only know that my next vehicle will not be a Dodge. Get one if you can an enjoy both worlds.",3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),A family vehicle but want something with some go. Have had my R/T for three years now (35k miles). This is the first 4 door car I have ever owned (traded in a 04 GTO on this one). Very quiet and comfortable drive with a ton of room. She definately will move out although the Magnum is a heavy car and dont expect cornering like a Vette or pure sports car. Gas mileage really depends on your foot. I typically get about 21 mpg (75% highway 25% around town). Only issues with the car Ive had which many have already noted: 1) Small tranny leak at 15k miles (was O-ring replaced by dealer and no further issues) 2) The OEM tires (Conti's) didnt last long and really stunk in rain/bad weather.,3.0
2005 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT Rwd 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),"I have 52,000 miles on my Magnum RT. It's an awsome car. Great exterior design, and the Hemi is a plus. I had a tranny leak 8 months ago. It was a seal...the dealership replaced it at no charge. The thermostat was replaced 3 months ago. Other than those 2 discrepancies, I really enjoy driving my Magnum. It is a little slipery to drive in the rain, I think that is typical of any RWD. I plan on keeping my Magnum for a long time...unless I can find another car that is as comfortable and looks just as cool.",3.0

The CD player & sunroof (doesn't open) stopped working 3000 miles ago & now the transmission is slipping! Some of this was covered under warranty but much of it has occurred just after the warranty ended. While the trans is still covered, the CD player/navigation system isn't ($2300).

Shame on you Dodge, you never really advertised this car much as it was that was your fault, all things considered it sold well to begin with.

But no car is perfect, especially when it's a new model. I am sure the list of complaints will be taken care of. Considering the size of the car I cannot complain about the gas mileage- I think it does well for her size and power. We took it to Florida and we were very comfy and it did great on gas. The ultimate ""Mom"" car that Dad loves to drive to take advantage of the get up and go. Mom is guilty of that too. It's a very roomy, family car that is really sharp looking.

Tires lasted just over 22k. Was told I overinflated them, but must've been dealership because I am never one to do it yourself. Tranny went out at 30k (it's a Mercedes tranny too!) & it took forever to fix! Then the temp gauge went out (can't remember why, but they had never seen the problem in all of the magnums they had seen in the shop), window went out, key fob died, still have a popping noise when I make sharp left turns, but never can be heard when in the shop.",3.0
